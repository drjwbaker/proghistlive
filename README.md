# Attendee Set-up Instructions

In order that you get the most from Programming Historian Live, we request that you both bring your own laptop with you and to install some software onto it beforehand.

Each session leader has provided set-up instructions below. These cover Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. If you have any trouble completing the set-up instructions for a particular session, please [log an issue](https://github.com/drjwbaker/proghistlive/issues) and we will attempt to resolve it.

## Shell

Windows users, see the section entitled 'Installing Git Bash' in the Programming Historian lesson [*Introduction to the Bash Command Line*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash). OS X and Linux users, simply make sure you know how to find your 'Terminal'.
