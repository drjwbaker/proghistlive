# Post-Event

Programming Historian Live took place on 19 October 2015. A reflective blog on the event written by James Baker is one [his blog](http://cradledincaricature.com/2015/10/21/programming-historian-live/).

Since the event, the presenters have uploaded slides, notes, and hand-outs they provided used on the day. We hope you are able to build on the materials to host comparable events. If you are interested in the project team running a Programming Historian Live event at your institution, please contact [James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker) to discuss.

## Set-up Instructions

In order that you get the most from Programming Historian Live, we request that you both bring your own laptop with you and to install some software onto it beforehand. *Note that we will not provide laptops. Nevertheless, not all sessions will require the use of a laptop throughout so you can follow along without one. If you do not bring your own laptop, you may wish to see if someone is willing to share for those sections that are hands-on.*

Each session leader has provided set-up instructions below. These cover Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. If you have any trouble completing the set-up instructions for a particular session, please [log an issue](https://github.com/drjwbaker/proghistlive/issues) and we will attempt to resolve it.

______

### XSLT
 
This session will demonstrate how to create XSL style sheets to transform your XML data into different forms, depending on the information you need and how you want it to be displayed.
 
You will need no special software for this session; any plain-text editor (such as notepad) will work. If you find your standard plain-text editor difficult to read (black on white), consider downloading the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/), which allows a range of colour schemes to suit your vision. You can also use Komodo Edit, detailed below.
 
To display your transformed documents, you will need to use either [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/download-ie) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), as Chrome and Safari browsers may (depending on your setup) have security features that prevent local transformations. Therefore, please ensure you have one of these two browsers on your laptop if you wish to test out your encoding on the day.

______

### Regular expressions

If you are bringing a laptop you might like to download the free, cross-platform editor Komodo Edit (http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) for this session. However if you already have an editor that you are comfortable using and that allows regular expressions in its find-and-replace tool then itâ€™s preferable to stay with the editor you know. The exercises can also be done on a web interface or on paper, so you are also welcome to bring a tablet or a notebook and pen for this session.

______

### AntConc

AntConc is a corpus analysis toolkit for concordancing and text analysis. You can download it from the [AntConc Homepage](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) where you will also find installation instructions.

______

### Shell

Windows users, see the section entitled 'Installing Git Bash' in the Programming Historian lesson [*Introduction to the Bash Command Line*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash). OS X and Linux users, simply make sure you know how to find your 'Terminal'.

Download the data for the session from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iyrtanzmik311dn/AAAmOlqrT_YdC5jxvonKIPRFa?dl=0). Extract the 'data' folder onto your desktop. Any problems, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/drjwbaker/proghistlive/issues).
