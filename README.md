## Set-up Instructions

In order that you get the most from Programming Historian Live, we request that you both bring your own laptop with you and to install some software onto it beforehand. *Note that we will not provide laptops. Nevertheless, not all sessions will require the use of a laptop throughout so you can follow along without one. If you do not bring your own laptop, you may wish to see if someone is willing to share for those sections that are hands-on.*

Each session leader has provided set-up instructions below. These cover Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. If you have any trouble completing the set-up instructions for a particular session, please [log an issue](https://github.com/drjwbaker/proghistlive/issues) and we will attempt to resolve it.

______

### Regular expressions

If you are bringing a laptop you might like to download the free, cross-platform editor Komodo Edit (http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/) for this session. However if you already have an editor that you are comfortable using and that allows regular expressions in its find-and-replace tool then itâ€™s preferable to stay with the editor you know. The exercises can also be done on a web interface or on paper, so you are also welcome to bring a tablet or a notebook and pen for this session.

______

### Shell

Windows users, see the section entitled 'Installing Git Bash' in the Programming Historian lesson [*Introduction to the Bash Command Line*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash). OS X and Linux users, simply make sure you know how to find your 'Terminal'.
