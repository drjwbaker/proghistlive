            <pb n="4"/>Commerce of Canada.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter.</p>
         <p>The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned at 62,000 souls, whilst her
                    exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90,000l) The imports must have greatly
                        exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the
                    differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas
                    may be rated at 320,000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may appear,
                    commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population.</p>
         <p>From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied from 120,000l. to 300,000l.
                    chiefly of wheat, furs, and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they
                    have increased to the surprising sum of 1,220,963l. 10s. Sterling, as
                    we shall presently perceive by the following estimate, which
                    cannot be much over or under the truth :-</p>
         <p>Furs and skims ... 105,000 0 Wheat, all other grain, flour, and
                    biscuit 136,500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536,500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223,000 0 Beets and
                    pork 30,000 0 Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ...
                    16,000 10 The hulls, masts, and yards, of 28 vessels built in the province ... 84,000 0 Total of domestic
                    produce 1,131,000 0 Sundry goods imported and exported 4,780 0
                        1,125,780 0 </p>
         <p>Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ...
                    65,183 0 t. 1,220,963 10</p>
         <p>The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380,000l.
                    Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not
                    dutiable ; but we may safely conlude, that they will make the total of import as one million Sterling, leaving a balance in
                    favour of these provinces, which, but a few years ago, would have appeared
                    incredible. This property is carried by 661 vessels, whose
                    tonnage is 143,893, navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage
                    on these vessels are nine guineas per ton, being 1,359,788l. 17s. Sterling,
                    which, without taking into consideration the charges in Britain,
                    will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed, exceed 3,000,000l.
                    Sterling, being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom.</p>
         <p>Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years
                    ago, our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants have begun to
                    settle amongst us, I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus
                    British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before
                    much thought of.</p>

         <p>This morning, some dispatches were received from Boston, which were
                    brought over in the Sally, Capt. Walker from Liverpool. They are dated
                    the 16th November, and contain an account of the arrival of
                    several ships from Newfoundland, and some from Halifax; that
                        provisions of all kinds were very plentiful and reasonable.</p>

      <header>Our latest accounts from...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Our latest accounts from the West Indies say, that no supply from the
                    islands, either of wheat or flour, can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by
                    his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity,
                    therefore, if we have any of these articles to spare, must be first
                    extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised, particularly when we
                    consider the present price of bread at home, that no assistance can be
                    given at present, either to the French or Dutch.</p>
         <p>The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest, except
                    to the eastward, which ahs generally been considered as the most
                    productive part.</p>
         <p>By the Westmoreland, just arrived from Jamaica, we learn that the
                    slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree, ever since
                    they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave
                    Trade.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Quebec, June
                        6.</p>
         <p>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great
                    scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning
                    in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats
                    3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken
                    of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and liberties, by
                    order of the Governor and Council, and we find there is not more than will
                    serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal
                    than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.</p>
         <p>"Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three
                    livres, now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of
                    fifteen hundred pounds by this job.</p>
         <p>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have caused to be issued, by the
                    contractor here, rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was
                    delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.</p>
         <p>"In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal, two
                    thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for
                    that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the
                    States, though we hear of a cargo from New York, for Montreal.
                    The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than
                    probably, that people there, being in great want themselves, have detained
                    her. The Government have done now what they should have
                    done five or six months ago, and then we should not be in this
                    starving condition ; that is, we are to have a proclamation to permit the
                    importation of grain and flour from the States.</p>
         <p>"My servant is just come home from the baker's, where I had sent
                    him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours,
                    till the bread came out of the overn, he could get but
                    eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, indeed, weighing only two pounds
                    each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit.
                    The Lord knows what will become of us–except
                    Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops,
                    in the Queen.</p>
         <p>"Mr. Davidson, one of the Council, assured us on Thursday last, there was
                    not wheat and flour</p>
         <p>in the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be
                    well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the
                        proclamation to allow the importation from the States.
                    He stood forth alone, and offered, at his own expence, to get an
                    account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town
                    and liberties of Quebec, and insisted on its being taken into
                    consideration."</p>

         <p>Cent is the only coinage the Americans have of
                    their won. No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in
                    the year 1787, to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the
                    contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey
                    copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British
                    copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of
                    all nations, however, pass current. The congress have not yet ordered a silver
                    coinage.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda tohis friend in Norfolk, Virginia, dated
                            April 2.</p>
         <p>"By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want
                    of provi- sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of
                    corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in
                    [?] days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immeddiately
                    at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour, common and
                    superfine, which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George;
                    and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great
                    number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on
                    the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, by advice of his counsel, has
                    opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty
                    days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, laden with bread,
                    corn; or flour. He also allows, for three months, the importation of salted
                        provisions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels
                    belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any foreign vessel
                    should come here after the time permited by proclamation, they
                    will be allowed to dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set
                    out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from
                    Norfolk, with provisions, advise them to call at Bermuda."</p>

      <header>THE following extract from...</header>
      <text>
         <p>THE following extract from a late publication, entitled, " A
                    State of the present Government of the Province of Quebec," will give
                    the public some idea of the Canada Bill, which has been so much talked of
                    an procrastinated so long, and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the production of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by the province to negotiate
                    this afair. It is remarkable,withhis former publication, for its
                    strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.</p>
         <p>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind. The security which
                    flows from a free constitution, to both political and civil liberty,
                    contributes greatly towards bringing forth the powers of the human
                    mind, and the encouragement of the industry of people ; but no
                        constitution can be called free where the people are
                    not allowed to participate of the legislative authority by
                    their representatives : This is the great criterion of freedom; and it is
                    extremely natural for all British subjects, as they know the value of
                    it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great Britain has
                    constantly acknoledged this principle in the constitution she has granted to all her Colonies; and by
                    that means has rendered them more flourishing and prosperous than those of
                        other nations. Although the inhabitants of the province of Quebec have,
                    from the general tendency of the British government to a mild
                        administration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liberty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature of the
                    system of their government, entirely deprived of all political
                    liberty. A more full enjoyment of these essential privileges has
                    been the prayer of their petitions, and of those now before the House of commons. The objects prayed for may be reduced to
                    the following heads:–</p>

            <pb n="3"/>Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a
                    stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East India Company,
                    and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired, the
                    stranger said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from India, I have
                    smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon
                    them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, "That he could receive no such
                    money without the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said the
                    stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved
                    to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege
                    of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any
                    part of the advantages they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion,
                    look upon himself as a strictly honest man." Since the stranger waited
                    on Mr. Sibbly, the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a letter,
                    including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if
                    he paid any thing.</p>

            <pb n="4"/>Extract of a letter from India, by the Dublin EastIndiaman, to Mr. William Jones</p>
         <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to Decca, and arrived there after a
                    passage of 16 days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, and it was
                    really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but
                    the corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and jackalls were
                    eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them
                    to ashes, if they can afford it; if not, throw them into the river. I
                    have lately seen a man brought to the river side, and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide
                    flowed, it carried him off. If a man, woman, or child, dies at
                    night, the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every
                    morning, I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In
                    the course of six months I became so much used to it, that I took no
                    notice of it.</p>
         <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place, and burnt upwards of
                    seven miles without intermission, and many souls perished. Now
                    consider, first, an inundation; second, a famine; and third, a
                    conflagration. How much the place must be distressed, I leave you to think.
                    I left Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at Calcutta, after
                    a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days), hearty and well, thank
                    God."</p>

            <pb n="2"/> The old system of sending men of rank to govern
                    Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably too.</p>
         <p>This island is the most important possession we hold in the West Indies, and
                    is well entitled to any mark of distinction which the parent country
                    can bestow upon it.</p>
         <p>The salary and emoluments annexed to the government of Jamaica, render it
                    the most valuable of any in the King's gift, except that of
                        Ireland.</p>
         <p>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed
                    Governor of Jamaica, and died in his Government.</p>
         <p>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was made Governor of this island in
                    the reign of George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, July 4th, 1736,
                    in the 45th year of his age.</p>
         <p>The death of these two Noblemen in their government, gave so bad an
                    impression of the climate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its
                    air, that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of
                    becoming governors of it, notwith standing the brilliancy of the
                    appointments an nexd to the situation.</p>

                        1789.</p>
         <p>"I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the
                    poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I
                    meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be
                    frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain, and they cannot have goods equal in
                    quality and price from any other place.</p>
         <p>"I think I never say so many children as are in this country, every town,
                    village, and farm-house, are full of them.–The people of this
                    country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double
                    their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a
                    shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods,
                    for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye [sic] idle
                    to be granted or purchased at a small price, the people of this country
                    never will manufacture ; At present wages are high, and 1000 acres of
                    land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many [pence?]."</p>

         <p>A short DESCRIPTION of, and
                    REMARKS upona new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY, being one of four settled by the Americans since1774.</p>
         <p>THAT no nation can serve the Americans with
                    goods equal in quality and price to Britain, is wha the whole world knows,
                    and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny:
                    It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform our readers, that the United
                    States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States
                    since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. Vermont,
                        Kentucky, Indiana, and The Western Territory.</p>
         <p>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only
                    began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in
                        forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has
                    been the population, that there are not less than one hundred thousand
                    inhabitants, already, in each of these states. The State of Indiana
                    was only laid off this present year in 1789, and contains
                    but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four
                    States, published in America in May last, we give our readers a short
                    abridged description of the last of them, called The
                        Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of
                    every Briton to read it, and think, that the settling of these countries,
                    though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years, will
                    long keep them from manufacturing, and is every day opening a
                    field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a
                    tradesman, even though wages are very high, when he can, for twenty
                    pounds, purchase a thousand acres of land, that being the
                    present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western
                    Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will
                    continually increase with the increasing population of
                    America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the
                    prospect, that new channels of commerce will be opened, and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages
                    ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by means of a most
                    extraordinary inland navigation, will be diffused through a country more
                    fertile, more extensive, than all the Thirteen United States.</p>
         <p>The Western TerritoryIs the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the
                    west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by
                    Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains,
                    according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General to the Congress, 411,000
                    square miles, equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres,
                    from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there
                    will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres
                    belonging to the fed–ral government, which is to be sold for
                    the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small
                    proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by
                    Congress*.</p>
         <p>On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two
                    settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta, the other at
                    Miami.</p>
         <p>This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787, and
                    already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the
                    Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhocking, Sioto, Miami,
                    Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron mines, and salt pits, abound in this
                    State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined, and may be
                    reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is
                    exceedingly healthy, pleasant, and commodious–the most fertile spot
                    of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall, and in
                    great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and
                    cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good
                    part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will
                    exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the description of travellers, who call it the garden ofthe world. It is here probably also that the center
                    of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It
                    is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No
                    country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of
                    deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive meadows of thie
                    country?turkies, geese, swans, and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The
                    rivers are excellently stored with fish, and almost all navigable for small sloops.</p>
         <p>In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory,
                    they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30,000 persons; and when they acquire a certain
                    degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when
                    fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into
                    States.</p>
         <p>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be supplied with
                    manufactures by you, and you only!</p>
         <p>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the
                    poor natives, for which Congress gave them only eight thousand
                    dollars value in goods and rum.</p>

         <p>[Continued from our last.]Carlisle, July 29.</p>
         <p>ON Saturday last between three and four
                    o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent hurricane pest, or thunder
                    storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was
                    ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing
                    but an earthquake, that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west, or rather a number of
                    clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously agitated, broken, and seemingly
                    ready to fall– attracted the attention, and prepared the mind
                    in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening appeared to
                    those who were at a distance, remarkably red, and seemed to
                    flash from the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick succession
                    or some time, as to appear one sheet of flame. This might have had a great
                    effect on the air, at some miles distance from town, to set it in
                    rapid motion, especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly
                    falling towards the earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell;
                    and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets,
                    and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a
                    most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a manner, that all
                    surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the
                    whole town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the column of
                    air move on: happily however, the damages were much less than
                    apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson, being an an elevated spot near the west end of the
                    town, and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column, was
                    the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the
                    square were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the roof was
                    carried over Mr. Paton's house, which stood at a small distance on the
                    east, striking it forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and
                    fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same
                    condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its
                    course to the eastward, the next elevated object to which it pointed
                    its fury, was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a
                    building of uncommon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to
                    stand for ages, admist all the war of the elements. About a
                    fourth part, however of the roof of the north side was carried off, with
                    the weighty cornice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred
                    yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the
                    centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the
                    public buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest the town.
                    Many fences in the neighbourhood, which were in the line of its direction,
                    were also thrown down; but how far it extended, or what damages the
                    farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it, however, not be
                        forgotten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the
                    good providence of God, not a single life was lost or any personal
                    injury, worth mentioning, received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon be restored to as
                    good a state as they were in before.</p>

         <p>We are happy in informing our readers, that in the memory of the oldest man
                    among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present.
                    Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy, and
                    full, and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful, and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of
                    the United Sates, to the great Author of Nature; especially when
                    these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy, and with the establishment of a wise,
                    free, and just government.</p>

         <p>Albany, Aug. 10.</p>
         <p>By a gentleman who arrived in this city on Friday last from the county of
                    Ontario in the Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this
                    state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we are informed, that four
                    days before he left that county, Colonel Brant from Niagara, at the
                    head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal Sachems, and other
                    Indians of the Six Nations, had arrived at Conadoque, the seat of Oliver
                    Phelps, Esq; on a visit of friendship, and at the same time to receive
                    the money due them for the lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and
                    Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal
                    inhabitants of Conadoque, four miles from that place, and conducted into
                    town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment they received, and with the manner in which they had disposed of
                    their lands.–The gentleman further informs, that there is
                    now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that the land is
                    of a good quality.</p>

         <p>New York, Aug. 20.</p>
         <p>The weather last week, in this city, and suburbs, continued to be
                    extremely hot until Sunday midnight, after a thunder squall. The change
                    which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy.</p>
         <p>Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week;
                    and it is said, that as many of them died by over labouring as by
                    drinking cold water, Raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this
                    extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before, suddenly fell on one of those days
                    –and the cry was–" Poor fellow! he has certainly drank too much cold water!" Cold water has however been
                    instantaneously fatal in se- veral instances. [To be
                        concluded in our next.]</p>

            <pb n="2"/> We have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of
                    a letter from Grenada, by the last West India Packet.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico, where he left the
                    white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea,
                    that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes
                    free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates
                    assembled together to the amount of 4000, and retired to the mountains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; saying,
                    that they had as good a right to be free, as the negroes in the English
                    islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say
                    that they had arms, and had resisted the military and the militia ;
                    and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular
                    that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its
                    appearance among the French negroes, if they are (as has been assented by
                    several writers) so much more civilized, so much better treated, than
                    those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow,
                    from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning, but ill
                    informed leaders among you."</p>

                    United States, as ever subsisted. It is in vain to instil
                    prejudices against Great Britain, in the mind of an American merchant ; he knows this to be the ready-money market, and he
                    will come to it accordingly.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in
                            Danville,(Kentucky) to his friend in Baltimore</p>
         <p>"It is with great concern I communicate to you the following truly
                    melancholy intelligence: –About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard
                        Chenoweth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the
                    officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his exposed plantation,
                    in Bear Crab Settlement, below the Falls. In the evening of
                    their arrival, before they had taken their station as a guard, a
                    number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house, killed two of the
                    soldiers, and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and
                        scalped his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead–
                    Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of
                    the men, made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's
                    children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, she never heard any
                    thing of the dreadful massacre; but, next morning, crawling down stairs,
                    she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned next day to his
                    house, and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation, where they are
                    both likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she wants to return
                    to her own house.–The savages have been very troublesome in this
                    neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River, to
                    extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have informed,
                    have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that place."</p>

         <p>"What mighty contests rise from trivial things;"</p>
         <p>That the present Revolution in France is a consequence of the
                    Revolution in America, cannot admit of a doubt. The American Revolution
                        originated in Adams, a very insignificant Bostonian. Not that this Adams had the least expectation of American independence, when he fomented the
                    opposition to the stamp-act; indeed no human wisdom could possibly have
                    foreseen the subsequent folly and imprudence of the British
                    administration and its obsequious Parliament. An Administration so totally
                    destitute of common sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of
                    sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had the sagacity to avail
                    himself of such despicable policies.–Fortunately for the American cause, the Generals that
                    were sent from England were of congenial abilities with the Minister, and
                    the Americans themselves were surprised at the facility
                    with which they acquired their independence. –Yet all the blunders
                    of the British administration, and the miserable conduct of the
                    British Generals, would hardly have been sufficient to emancipate
                    America, notwithstanding her extreme weakeness, without the
                    assistance of France; and this assistance depended entirely on Dr.
                    Franklin being driven to Paris by the fatal-philippic of a
                    certain great lawyer. Such, therefore, is the chain of concurrent
                    circumstances that hath overturned the French monarch. If the British
                    minister had possessed common sagacity–if he could have
                    distinguished a general from a corporal; if Franklin had been
                    treated with common civility, America would have remained a British
                    colony, and France an absolute monarch, for ages yet to come.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="6"/>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mileend, received
                    the following letter from a friend in Holland last week:</p>
         <p>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here from the East Indies,
                    desires me to inform you, that your unfortunate relation who left you with
                    the transports for Botany Bay, was well in February last.
                    He has settled at Port Jackson, and has leave to teach the children of some
                    of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much
                    improved since you ahve had any letters form it, as there was no person
                    without a habitation, and being in some order, when he left it. Except
                    wearing apparel, very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank
                    the Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought several useful
                    things there. The last crops of corn, and the garden grounds, were in very
                    good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient, one of
                    the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for
                    use and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or
                    elsewhere. He was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes,
                    and houses without windows, and full of wicker and rush furniture,
                    which is used in the place of almost every thing else. If the smiths had a
                    plentiful supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would be
                    wanting. Your nephew has two children, and says all that are born there are
                    very healthy, and more born than are buried or executed of grown
                    people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he
                    came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people, they might
                    have a place to themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom
                    visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away, that as
                    soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over, they would go
                    farther than ever up the country, when some valuable discovers are expected
                    to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic, which
                    is veyr useful. He expects several of your people will go from
                    Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old
                    clothes is not yet found out. Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that
                    it is not worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as little is said about it there, as if it was as far off as Europe, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>

      <header>The West India...</header>
      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="6"/> The West India merchants, who were in the utmost anxiety for the
                    arrival of the packet from the West Indies, have been most agreebly
                        relieed from their apprehensions. The account of the
                    insurrections in Martinique, which we received through France, and
                    which has been since confirmed in the National Assembly,
                    naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy
                    to inform our readers, that the packet brings no intelligence whatever
                    of tumult of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring
                    any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a circumstance which can
                    only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the
                    islands at this season of the year."</p>

                         6.</p>
         <p>"This day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed, was
                    discovered in Martinico : It was an insurrection of the negroes, who were
                    that night to have set fire to the large and beautiful town of St.
                    Pierre ; while the white people were all in confusion, and striving to
                    escape the flames, they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man
                    woman, and child.–The combustibles were laid in upwards of 100
                    houses, consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine. The plot was
                    not discovered till five o'clock in the evening, when a negro belonging to an old lady, stung with remorse on thinking that
                    he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child, disclosed it to
                    her. The Troops being thereupon assembled, 40 of the negroes were
                    taken, armed with a hanger and a long knife, the insturments which were in
                    a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever
                    since, as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are
                    in gaol."</p>

      <text>
         <p>" Living out of the World"</p>
         <p>To the PRINTER.</p>
         <p>Sir,</p>
         <p>ABOUT two month ago I went to the country to pay a visit to a friend in a remote county; and though I am much
                    of what may be called "a newspaper man," I never thought
                    of ordering my papers to be sent down to me. To my utter
                    astonishment, my rustic landlord did not take in own
                    newspaper; so there was I, stuck down, with my friend in the
                    country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had
                    been in Lapland. Intending every day should be
                    my last, I went on without ordering your, or any other paper, till two
                    months had passed away, at which period I returned to town. And there,
                    Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had dropped down from the
                    clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I
                    knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders, against the
                    Emperor, who I thought was fighting against the Turks.</p>
         <p>But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a
                    friend, I inquired very cordially after his wife, who I found a
                    few days afterwards, had eloped just before with another
                    gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquired kindly for
                    her sister, who I found had departed to the other world a
                    fortnight before.</p>
         <p>On this account I never will stir again "out of the world" unless your paper
                    goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided, and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It.
                    is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the
                    fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead
                    friends, or wives that have absconded.</p>
         <p>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my creed–and never will I again travel without my faith along with me :
                    having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the
                    world as ignorant as if I had been born again–I
                        hereby give notice– "That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me, who does not take in your
                    paper or some other– I will not visit him."DICK
                        DESPERATE.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Account of a singular Sect calledShaking QuakERSinAmerica.</p>
         <p>IN the United States of America there are some
                    Jews, and various denomications of Christians, –as Roman
                    Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers,
                    Dunkers, Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, Sandimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to
                    perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their
                    consciences.</p>
         <p>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that sprang up about the year 1769 : an
                    old woman called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all of which
                    were said to be Europeans, were the founders of this new mode of worship ;
                    they drew thousands of people after them, who pretended they were
                    visited with power from on high to work miracles, heal the sick, raise the
                    dead, cast out devils, and speak in unknown languages.</p>
         <p>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York, where
                    she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:–
                    afterwards she rambled from place to place, promulgating
                    her religion, and gaining proselytes in New England, and
                    elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and
                    followers, to the seculsion of all others.</p>
         <p>She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she
                    travelled in pain for her elect, –could speak in seventry-two
                    unknown languages, in which she conversed with those that had departed this life,–that there had not been a true
                    church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, until her's was
                    erected,–that both the living and the dead must be saved, in, by,
                    and through her –must confess their sins unto her, and procure
                    her parson, or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered
                    her church from both earth and hell, as every person that had died since
                    the time of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was damned, and
                    that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation, which
                    was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues.</p>
         <p>Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their
                    sins, and deliver up their jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches,
                    &amp;c. to be disposed of as she thought fit.</p>
         <p>It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very
                    beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things
                    that had been laid to innocent persons.</p>
         <p>When these people carry on their worship, they pretend to praise the Lord by
                    singing, dancing, jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling,
                    &amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, groaning,
                    sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are preaching, praying, exhorting,
                    &amp;c. others will be clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, screaming, and making such a hideous noise, that it may be heard
                    at a great distance, and will often affrighten the spectators.</p>
         <p>They often dance three hours without intermission, and when any
                    of them are tired of praising the Lord that way, they are
                    whipped by others, to make the worship go on briskly. They dance till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale,
                    appear like ghosts or apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard,
                    –if I may use the sailor's phrase.</p>
         <p>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of water baptism in their
                    churchs; are averse to wars, fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain
                        language, and cry–yea, and nay, instead of yes and no: but the other Quakers do not approve of all
                    their tenets.</p>
         <p>At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations,
                    and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness.</p>
         <p>They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels, and that
                    they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed
                    friends.</p>
         <p>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, because they suppose they are
                    part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the
                    Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, and were not defiled
                    with women.</p>
         <p>They hold, that they have already been made partakers of the first
                    resurrection, and that on them the second death will have no power.</p>
         <p>They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches, because they
                    suppose it was ceremonial, and is abolished;–but pretend
                    that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence
                    of the Holy Ghost, and that they have scripture warrents for their
                    practice, a[?]– Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance;
                    –O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on to
                    God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the
                    Lords,&amp;c.</p>

         <p>Advices from Baltimore, in Maryland, say that all the wheat and flour
                    that could be purchased was actually contracted for throughout
                    that fertile province, on the 10th of October last, for the French
                    market, and it was thought the same man–uvre had taken place at New

         <p>Martinique, Oct.
                        6.</p>
         <p>The disturbances in this island are so far from having abated, that they
                    seem daily to gain additional force. The French General, after
                    the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to
                    his side, against the people : He began with subalterns, several of whom
                    took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to
                    them ; but when he came to the Major, that officer
                    declined, saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply, he reviled him in
                    very opprobrious terms, and at last laid his cane upon him !</p>
         <p>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, he made his next application
                    to the regiment of artillery, but with as little success. They informed him, that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people, and
                    for them only should be used.</p>
         <p>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested the sorry expedient of
                    having recourse to the people of colour, who here form a
                    considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people, so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention, promised
                    to stand by him ; and did so, as long as they usually stand firm to any
                    thing–that is, till their fears for their own persons became an
                        object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him.</p>
         <p>The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this
                    motley rabble, were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called
                    them his enfansand cher amis, and practised all the dirty condescensions, which those only who are conversant in the
                    praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any conception of.</p>
         <p>The effect of this conduct was, as might be expected,
                    insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a
                    grenadier–this incensed both the military and the
                    peopl–the consequence was, their doughty leader was laid hold of,
                    when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into
                    confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his
                    prison, him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike
                    White, suspended on a gibbet.</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be
                    taken on this occasion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring
                    the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial, and twelve
                    Judges were chosen to preside at that very important
                    tribunal.</p>
         <p>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which time a rumour prevailed that
                    the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and
                    ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a
                    cross-cut saw.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia,
                            Aug. 23.</p>
         <p>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and from the multiplicity of
                    business before them, there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing.
                    We are curious to know what foreigners will say</p>
         <p>of our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one
                    opinion, and that is faavourable. o our own vessels, a
                    preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and
                    merchandise, there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage
                    acts, every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties
                    themselves, they could not be laid lower, considering the
                    demand of supplies, which the Committee appointed to give in an
                    estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars.</p>
         <p>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and
                    commerce, we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes.
                    Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral
                    government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it
                    respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late
                    contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation
                    flowing from the same source, industry has in a great degree succeeded.
                    A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that
                    was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption
                    of those concerned deriving advantage.</p>
         <p>"Throughout the union, the public opinion on matters of government has of
                    late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in
                    his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated the absurdity of
                    democracy, and the superior excellence of a mix form, such as
                    that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just, have
                    abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every
                    thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise
                    many, were United America to have a sovereign earin the
                    next century.</p>
         <p>"In no one instance has our new admnistration given general
                    satisfaction, more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests
                    of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to
                    ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless
                    violence of the individuals or States, who wished to wrest their lands from
                    them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for
                    it is now become the interest of the States to check, by every means short
                    of violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, who, when
                    removed to the wilds beyond the mountains, cannot be regarded as of any
                    value, in a political view.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which is only about nine miles
                    to the Northward of Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of
                    Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the world, in which 1000
                    sail of the line might ride in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in
                    honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in preference, which is
                    about hal a mile in length, and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance.
                    Here was the finest spring water, and ships can anchor so close in
                    short, that at a very small expence quays may be constructed, at which the
                    largest vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with the natives
                    here was friendly and uninterrupted. The appearance of the place was
                    picturesque and pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for
                    botanical acquisitions.</p>

      <header>The Minister is now...</header>
      <text>
         <p>The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans, which
                    will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and
                    Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In
                    feeling the former, the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to
                    encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are
                    comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are
                    the descendants of French, and are Roman Catholics. The
                    former are Protestants.</p>
         <p>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, were not fonder of peace than Mr.
                    Pitt. Conquests may be made by war, but consequence and
                    wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, if the first
                    commercial nation in the world.</p>
         <p>Besides these considerations, the grand secret has been discovered since the
                    present Minister came into power, that the best riddance England ever
                    had, was of her American Colonies ; because by this means, she becomes
                    thoroughly collected at home, to oppose every foreign power, without
                    the expence and blood of supporting the Americans, at the
                    same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in
                    one line or another.</p>
         <p>Thus, they are under the necessity of protecting themselves, at
                    the same time, that, like the rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to
                    our superior mercantile market.</p>
         <p>Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order
                    on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin, in aid of the present want of silver for circulation, the scarcity of which
                    is much felt by retail traders in particular.</p>

      <header>Letters from Jamaica say,...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arrived there from
                    Hispaniola, there are advices that the French inhabitants of that island
                    feel, with unabating energy, the glorious cause in which their
                    patriotic countrymen in Old France are embarked. Men of every
                    class and description wear the national cockade of blue and white. Their
                    accounts from France, similar in date and substance to
                    ours, have filled them with the most lively hopes, and animated them with a
                    spirit of resistance to the measures of their Government, as forcible
                    as it was unexpected by those entrusted with the executive
                    power. At Port au Prince both the Governor and Intendant have rendered
                    themselves completely odious, by vain attempts to counteract an
                    impulse that is irresistible. The effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has
                    been hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that both shall
                    immediately quit the colony, and their departure is hourly expected. The
                    press, hitherto under the severest restraint, triumphs in its
                        freedom; and their weekly publications give an account of the proceedings of the States General without the
                    smallest reserve.</p>

      <header>The following philosophical facts...</header>
      <text>
         <p>The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter
                    now setting in, will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked,
                    that when this season commences early, and with severity,
                    in Newfoundland, and the more northern part of North America, it becomes
                    extremely rigorous, and of a proportionate continuance there.
                    When, in the above climate, the winters have been severe, they have
                    invariably been mild with us, and vice versa. Now,
                    the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last, saw the hills already covered with snow. There
                    is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to
                    the setting in of a severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always
                    observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits, as a
                    nourishment to the smaller birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet
                    of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to prevent their
                    coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The
                    present season, the store of these wild fruits is extremely
                        moderate.</p>

      <text>
         <p>By letters from America, dated the 5th ult. we learn, that wheat is so
                    great a crop all over the Provinces, that it has fallen at Virginia to [?]
                    a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency,
                    about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which has reduced the price in
                    France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago.</p>
         <p>Two ships, laden with American wheat, have already arrived at Bristol, where
                    the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders
                    are sent to America for wheat, of which there has been a prodigious
                    crop.</p>

         <p>"By a vessel which arrived here yesterday from Martinique, we are informed,
                    that there is an insurrection of the slaves in that island ; at
                    one periot it was supposed that there was not less than ten
                    thousand of them assembled in one body, and there are now above four
                    thousand encamped in the neighbourhood of St. Pierre's. The business, it is said, has originated from an idea they have got, that all the slaves in the British colonies are
                    to be liberated, and they are resolved to be upon the same footing."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Portsmouth,
                            Nov. 23.</p>
         <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port from Newfoundland, are near
                    fourscore in number; a few others are expected. These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering,
                    and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is
                        accurateas follows: About the middle of last June, this
                    miserable class of beings, to the amount of 102 men and boys, and twelve
                    women, all of whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, on board
                    the Duke of Leinster transport, the owners of which, who are Dublin
                    merchants, contracted with the Government of Ireland for carrying the
                    convicts to the North American States.</p>
         <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, part of which was foul weather,
                    the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for Newfoundland
                    and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little
                    distance from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his desperate freight.</p>
         <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early early known, he landed with them
                    provision for the immediate supply of their wants, and bore away with
                    a press of sail. The hungry victims lived for three days in a state of
                    warfare, quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak,
                    and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there was for a time as severe
                    fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake.</p>
         <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the
                    most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military and navy co-operating, a place of security was fixed upon at a
                    distance from the town, and they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
         <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus, and the centinels were
                    frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A
                    battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day; and when the
                    provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening, they broke
                    away, and laid hold of every thing that was eatable, without enquiring whether it had an owner.</p>
         <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of
                    the inhabitants and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. But
                    all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of
                    raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement
                    weather."</p>

      <text>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at CharlesTown, South Carolina, September 2, 1789, to a friend in Bristol.</p>
         <p>"My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the
                    water, that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched
                    have I been at times, that I can hardly support the regret I feel,
                    that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation
                    England, for the dreary the desolate scenes of America.</p>
         <p>"Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a
                    situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State.
                    They are all in the secret, sighing for the comforts of Old
                    England. A bare pittance there, would be preferable to the largest
                    possessions here."</p>

                    multitude are out of employ, and who cannot get into any situations by

                    falls vacant, a croud of necessitous candidates immediately urge
                    their distresses, and it is certainly a fact, that, for one appointment,
                    there are thirty Englishmen who would be happy to obtain it, so many
                    have gone out lately to India, for whom there is no employment. </p>

      <text>
         <p>Boston, October 26.</p>
         <p>Saturday, between the hours of two and three, arrived in town from New-York,
                    the PRESIDENT of the United States.</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of this metropolis have now the happiness to
                    felicitate themselves on having among them the virtuous General, who
                    delivered their capital from the oppression of a British foe; and in
                    the same person the magnanimous President of the United States
                    of America.–The President left New-York on Thursday the 15th
                    instant, to visit the Eastern States, attended ouly by his
                    two private secretaries and servants– Actuated by the principles of
                    a true republican Patriot, and considing in the ardent
                    affections of the citizens in the States through which he had to pass,
                    he had it in vic??? travel without
                    the</p>
         <p>temporary parade which his dignified station might justly clam but
                    wherever he came his merits were already known, and the people, with
                    heartfelt joy, and high approbation of his virtues, saluted him the
                    Defender of their Freedom and Independence. –The worthy Governor of
                    this Commonwealth haivng an exalted estimation of the virtuous President, and although much indisposed as to his health, was
                    determined to shew the President the honours of the government in a stile
                    suitable to his dignity; accordingly he ordered the troops of
                    Middlesex horse to escort him through that county, and
                    permitted General brooks to exhibit to the President on Cambridge Common,
                    as he passed, a fine body of the militia of the 3d division,
                    consisting of about 1000 men, all in complete uniform and
                    equipment. The President was honoured with a salute as he passed
                    them. The Governor requested the Lieutenant Governor and the Council,
                    to meet the President at Cambridge (and would have accompanied them himself
                    hand his health permitted) whither they were escorted by col. Tyler's
                    corps of the horse. The Lieutenant governor and Council met him
                    there, and preceded the President under the escort of horse, and
                    introduced him to the capital of the commonwealth.</p>
         <p>From the best accounts we are able to collect, we present the following as
                    the</p>
         <p>Order of Procession.The Independent company of Light Infantrycommanded by Major Otis.The Independent Fusiliers, commanded by Cap-tain-lieutenant Laughton.The Independent Cadets, under the command ofMajor Scollay.Company of Artillery, commanded by CaptainJohnson./[Altogether commaned by Colonel Bradford.]Music.Constables of the town.Deputy-Sheriffs.The Select-Men.Town-Clerk.Committee of Arrangements.The High Sheriff.the Council of the Commonwealth.The Lieutenant-GovernorMarshal of Massachusetts District.The PRESIDENT on horseback;with his Suite.Overseers of the Poor.Town-Treasurer.Magistrates.Consul of Holland.The Reverend Clergy.Physicians, &amp;c.Lawyers.Merchants, shopkeepers, and Traders.Then followed the Artizans, Tradesmen, nufacturers, &amp;c. of the
                    town, in order, with flags, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>On the President's arrival at the State-house, he ascended a temporary
                    balcony, adjoining the gallery, where were a select choir of singers, who,
                    upon the President's appearance, sang the following</p>
         <p>ODE to Columbia's Favourite
                        SON.1.Great Washington, The Hero's come, Each
                    heart exulting hearts the sound, Thousands to their Deliverer throng,
                    And shout him welcome all around! Now its full chorus join the songs,
                    And shout aloud great Washington!</p>
         <p>2.There view columbia's favourie Son, Her Father, Saviour, Friend, and
                    Guide! There see th' immortal Washington!
                    His Country Glory, Boast, and Pride Now in full chorus, &amp;c. 3.When the impending storm of War, Think clouds and darkness hid our
                    way, Great Washington, our Polar Star,
                    Arose; and all was light as day. Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>4.'Twas on your plains they valour rose, And ran like fire from man to
                    man; 'Twas here thou humbled Paria's foes, And chac'd whole legions to
                    the main! Now in full corus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>5.Thro' countless dangers, toils and ???Our Hero led us safely on– With matchless skill directs the
                    wars, 'Till Vict'ry cried–The day's his own! Now in full
                    chorus,&amp;c.</p>
         <p>5.His country sav'd, the contest o'er, Sweet peace restor'd his toils to
                    crown, The Warrior to his native shore Returns, and this his fertile
                    ground. Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>7.But soon Columbia call'd him forth Again to save her sinking fame,
                    To take the helm, and by his worth To make her an immortal name!
                    Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>8.Nor yet alone thro' Paria's shores Her fame, her might trumpt blown;
                    E'en Europe, Afric, Asia, hears, And emulate the deed he's done!
                    Now in full chorus, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>After which, the procession passed by the President, under the
                    gallery, and then dispersed, highly satisfied with the occasion
                    of their assembling, and fully participating in the joy of the day.</p>
         <p>The Independent Companies then escorted the President to his residence in
                    Court-street–fired three vollies, and then dismissed.</p>
         <p>In the evening the several public houses in State-street were illuminated,
                    the Coffee House, Bunch of Grapes, Eastern Coffee House, &amp;c.
                    together, which mad a beautiful appearance.</p>
         <p>Fire works were also displayed in the said street.</p>
         <p>Rockets were likewise thrown from the French ships in the harbour, and from
                    Castle William.</p>
         <p>Two French frigates, L'Active and Le Sensible, were delightfully
                    illuminated, the former with several hundred lamps, judiciously arraigned.</p>
         <p>It is supposed the number assembled upon the above occasion, amounted to
                    24,000 persons. No unfavourable accident happened during the whole
                    scene–that we have heard of.</p>
         <p>The regularity and good order in the procession afforded to the
                    marhals the highest satisfaction, as well as to the numerous
                    spectators.</p>

      <text>
         <p>October 31. We are informed by very respectable authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the
                    United States, a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the
                    disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he
                    expected to prove, to a demonstration, that he has not acted the
                    inconsistent part which some have alleged, neither has there been such
                    cruelties committed by the Indians.</p>
         <p>From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and considering he was educated
                    in Europe, being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no
                    reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people; but, on
                    the contrary, it is rather to be presumed that his proposals, which are
                        contained in his letter to the President, are of a rational
                    nature, and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous
                    treaty with the United States.</p>

      <header>November 12  On Thursday...</header>
      <text>
         <p>November 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de
                    Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of
                    respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre, of
                    seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge,
                    received the company at Foster's wharf, before 12 o'clock–and
                    on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board, a signal gun
                    was fired from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron
                    was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On
                    arriving at the ship, the company were very politely received by the
                    Viscount, and conducted to the state room–the marines saluting
                    as the company passed them. At one o'clock the whole sat down to a
                    table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a
                    hall erected for the occasion, which was very fancifully
                    decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry, having
                    thirteen metal guns, by which from tubes that communicated through the
                    table, and the company were saluted with a f–deral discharge. On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign–the
                    device, two hearts–the motto, "The United hearts of America and France." The head
                    of the hall was ornamented with a heartpieced with arrows–and in the motton, "Homage to the fair daughters of America," a fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female
                    guests. After dinner, the ball began, and closed before nine o'clock, and
                    on departure, his Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off
                    from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.</p>
         <p>Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain averse to the new
                    government; they refuse allegiance to all acts of the States,
                    and, of course, do not participate in any privilee; they are treated
                    in respect to port entries, &amp;c. as foreign States.</p>

            <pb n="2"/> By the last letters from India, we understand they were going on
                    in the plodding way, with nothing new or important.–The markets are
                    overstocked with British goods, so as to enable our countrymen to
                    supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at
                    home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord
                    Cornwallis is as strict as ever, who is expected to remain another year
                    among them, to the no small regret of those who left England for the
                    sake of Oriental wealth.</p>
         <p>Our female adventurers have also found it a bad
                    market ; British beauty never fails of finding its
                    admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit, of which neither civil nor military dare to think
                    of tasting.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Characterof theFemale Sex.By Mr.Ledyard, a celebrated traveller.</p>
         <p>I have always remarked that women, in all countries, are civil, obliging,
                    tender, and humane; that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheerful, timorous and modest : and that they do not hesitate,
                    like men, to perform a generous action. Not haughty, not arrogant, not
                    supercilious, they are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more
                    liable in general to err than man, but in general also more virtuous,
                    and performing more good actions than he. To a woman, whether civilized or savage, I never addressed myself in the language of decency and friendship, without receiving a decent
                    and friendly answer. With men it has been otherwise.</p>
         <p>In wandering over the barren plains of inhos-pitable Denmark, through honest
                        Sweden and fro-zen Lapland, rude, and churlish Finland, unprin-cipled Russia, and the widespread
                        regions of the wandering Tartar ; if
                    hungry, dry, cold, wet, or sick, the women have ever been friendly to
                    me, and uniformly so ; and to add to this virtue (so worthy the
                    appellation of benevolence) these actions have been performed in so free
                    and so kind a manner, that if I was dry I drank the sweetest draught,
                    and if hungry I eat the coarse morsel with a double relish.</p>

            <pb n="7"/> We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th
                    May, from which the following is extracted:–</p>
         <p>Quebec, May 20.</p>
         <p>We hear late accounts from Niagara mention, that the Indians in that quarter
                    are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received
                    by them from the States, that they had now raised an army
                    to take their own for Niagara, and that two thousand men of that army were
                    now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye
                    still and look on, and that they would punish those that should
                    interfere.</p>
         <p>It was also said, that the people of New York were determined of themselves
                    to lay open the post of Oswego, and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited
                    by that event.</p>
         <p>We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great
                    benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying
                    their lands from them, to think of accepting any more from that
                    quarter, and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty
                    on this side the Atlantic, before they testify their impatience, that
                    national treaties, like private agreements, are not to be infringed by one
                    and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive.</p>
         <p>[As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara, they have
                    long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.]</p>
         <p>May 24.</p>
         <p>The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington, have received
                    letters from the Captain Kendrick, dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them, that he passed the winter preceding on the
                    north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further
                    northward, and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The
                    letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had
                    been at Nootka, and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New
                    York. They were covered to the President of the United States of
                    America.</p>
         <p>[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last, (see
                        Glasgow Intelligence, p. 424) and what is
                    mentioned above, it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between
                    the Americans and Spaniards, as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for
                    the President of the States without making the least mention (from
                    what is made public) of any British ships
                    being then at Nootka Sound.]</p>

      <text>
         <p>By recent letters from America we learn, that the Congress of the nited
                    States, after warm debates in both Houses, particularly in that
                    of the Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of fixing
                    permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania.</p>
         <p>The two new provinces in North America, Kentucky and Vermont, whose
                    population already is so very considerable, were formed by the vast
                    numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and
                    ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies, and
                    though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, yet they
                    have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks
                    of the great river Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other
                    states, they can either navigate northerly to the lakes, or southerly
                    to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry
                    on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed
                    of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world, the position of which
                    they ??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and from
                    thence, as their views ???tend, to every
                    country in Europe. Thus, from the most distressed situation, to rise to
                    opulence and independence ina few years, must excite admiration.</p>
         <p>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the peculiar province of
                    American industry, from whence wealth will flow into every part of that
                    vast country, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land,
                    level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended savannahs;
                    while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for
                    the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin,
                    yet the provinces produce the finest meadows, form whence a
                    provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of
                        Europe, not affording sufficient crops of grain for the
                    support of their inhabitants, on account of the remarkable encrease of
                    population, and which is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are
                    every where extended: America may, therefore, be deemed, in future,
                    the granary of this quarter of the globe.</p>

            <pb n="1"/>A humorous Adventure of a Marriage negotiated by
                        a Bill of Exchange, in one of the English WestIndia Islands.</p>
         <p>A Merchant, originally from London, having
                    acquired a great fortune in this island, concluded with
                    himself he could not be happy in the enjoyment of it, unless[?] he
                    shared[?] it with a woman of merit ; and knowing none to his
                    fancy he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of his in London.
                    He know no other [?] than that he used in his trade ; therefore treating
                        affairs of love as he did his business, after giving
                    his friend in a letter several comissions, and reserving
                    this for the last, he went on thus : Item[?],seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, and that I do not find
                    a suitable match for me here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound
                    hither, a young woman of the qualifications and form following: As for
                    a portion I demand none ; let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and
                    25 years of age ; of a middle stature, and well proportioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, her character blameless,
                    her heatlh good, and her constitution strong enough to bear the change of
                    the climate, that there may be no occasion to look out for a second
                    through lack of the [?] soon after she comes to hand ; which must be provided against as much as possible, considering the great
                    distance and dangers of the sea. If she arrives, and conditioned as
                    abovesaid, with the present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an attested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake or
                    imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself satisfy the said letter, by
                    marrying the [?] at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] [?],
                    [?]."</p>
         <p>The London correspondent read over and over the odd article, which put the
                    future [?] on the same footing with the bales of good he was to send
                    to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the prudent exactness of the
                    naturalized Creole, and his laconic stile, in enumerating the
                    qualifications he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him to his mind
                    ; and after many enquiries, he judged he had found a lady fit for his
                    purpose, in a young person of a reputable family, but no fortune ; of good humour, and of a polite education ; well
                    shaped, and more than tolerably handsome. He made the proposal
                    to her as his friend has directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had
                    no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who gave her a great deal of
                    uneasiness, accepted it. A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting
                    out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board the same, together with
                    the bales of goods, being well provided with all necessaries, and
                    particularly with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by the
                    correspondent. She was also included in the invoice, the last article of
                    which ran thus : "Item, a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape
                    and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the affadavits and
                    certificates she has to produce." Writings, which were thought necessary to
                    so exact a man as the future husband, were an extract from the parish
                    register ; a certificate of her character, signified by the
                    curate ; an attestation of her neighbours, setting forth that she had for
                    the space of three years lived with an old aunt who was intolerably
                    peevish, and that she had not, during all that time, given her said aunt,
                    the least occasion of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her
                    consitution was certified after [?] by [?] [?]. [?] [?] departure
                    the London correspondent sent several letters of advice by other
                    ships to his friend, whereby he informed him that per such a [?] he
                    sent him a young woman of such an age, character, and condition
                    &amp;c. in a word, such [?] desired to marry. The letters of advice, the
                    bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the port ; and our Creole, who
                    happened to be one[?] of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing
                    was charmed to see a handsome person, who having heard him
                    called by his name, told him, "Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and
                    you know that it is not usually for people to carry a great deal of
                    money about them in such a long voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour
                    you will pleased to pay it." At the same time she gave him his
                    correspondent's letter, on the back of which was wrote, " The bearer of
                    this is the spouse you ordered me to send you." Ha, [?][?]
                    ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my bills to be protested, and I
                    swear this shall not be the first : I shall reckon myself the most
                    fortunate of all men, if you allow me to discharge it." Yes, Sir,
                    replied she, and the more willingly, since I am apprized of your character.
                    We have several persons of honour on board, who knew you very well,
                    and who, during my passage have answered all the questions I asked them
                        concerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that it
                    has raised in me [?] for you." This first interview was in a few days after
                        followed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent.
                    The new married couple are satisfied with their happy union made by
                    [?] of exchange, which was the most fortunate that had happened in that
                    island for many years.</p>

                    rain, which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober.
                    The Summer grains are also abundant, and those on the ground,
                    especially Indian corn, equally promising. Should Europe require
                    wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year, we shall draw
                    a very large balance from them in specie.</p>
         <p>The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded,
                    brought many foreigners into deep speculations, which reduced bills of
                    exchange to par.</p>

         <p>A Transfer ofConjugal
                    Love.</p>
         <p>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a
                    female on whom he had fixed his affections. It is to
                    be observed, that he did not toil through the tedious forms of
                    courtship, but at once got a wife, as others sometimes get
                    good places, by purchase–and, as we are
                    informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas and thirty yards of Irish
                    cloth, at 2s. 6d. per yard–which property he deposited in exchange
                    for earthly treasure.–Whether a wife may be
                    cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her former husband,
                    having seen military service, was not to be discomposed at trifles, and his philosophyprobably being strengthened on the occasion, he attended the happy
                    pair to church, and saw the marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the
                    evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was gaity. The first
                    husband parted with an helpmate had borne his
                        sorrows twelve years ; and the second husband received a partner of his joys,after having buried a former one just a week.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>Court of Chancery.TheKing, at the relation of theBishopofLondon, versusAndersonandGipps.</p>
         <p>On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l.
                    to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which the
                    sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary, in
                    New England, to be applied for the purpose of propagating the
                    Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in
                    North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same
                    College, for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The
                    city of London were left trustees, and the management under the trust was,
                    by the will, committed to the care of the Bishop of London.
                    The present Bishop instituted this suit, in which the city, and a great
                    number of other persons, were parties, for the single, and
                    indeed novel purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had
                    originally devised the several sums for the use ofBritish subjects, and the Americans having ceased
                    to be in that situations since their independence),
                    the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, or to some other of
                    his Majesty's colonies, to be applied to similar purposes. This being the
                    first determination of that nature since the American Revolution, the
                    Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that
                    always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient–
                    "all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake
                    up the ashes of the dead, in search of latent intentions. The annuities and
                    arrears must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, and likewise the
                    city of London, must be paid their costs." </p>

         <p>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of
                    St. Paul's, which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity and</p>
         <p>amazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening
                    service, which they readily complied, and seemed particularly delighted with the organ.</p>
         <p>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges
                    us to make them some acknowledgement, whether we accept their offer or
                    not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club,–all our housebreakers, highwaymen, pick pockets, swindlers, Faro and E O Table
                    keepers,–and all their accomplices to an amazing
                    number.</p>
         <p>Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are
                    found dispersedly all the qualities of able Generals,–skilful
                    Financiers, –able Negotiators, active Citizens,–and men
                    highly expert at a Coup de Main.</p>
         <p>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,–the Cherokee Chiefs might on
                    their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their
                    enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success.</p>
         <p>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ;
                    and it is the opinion of most people, that a few thousands of the latter
                    description of men might be spared.</p>

         <p>By letters from the New York Packet, dated October 6, from
                    Philadelphia, we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the
                        Southern States, and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up
                    for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods, imported the last
                    season was immense, goods selling for considerable loss ;
                    and such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a
                    ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of
                    commercial advantages, and a seven years war is what the Americans were all
                        earnestly wishing for.</p>

      <text>
         <p>When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Coventgarden Theatre,
                    one of them appeared much delighted with the splendid appearance
                    of an Indian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; this
                    being observed, the performer was directed the performance; the Chief,
                    amazed at the offer of the magnificent present, said, through his interpreter, " that even in his won country he should be
                    unable to repay it ; however, at present he would do the utmost
                    in his power ;" on this he ordered the actor to approach him, and then
                    lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles,
                    he too three whiffs himself, and presenting the tube, desired the
                    actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could
                    confer ; the actor, aastonished at the singularity of this
                    unexpected honour, reluctantly complied with the request,to the
                    great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>DOMINICA.St. Pierre, Martinico, Sept. 11</p>
         <p>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; is so much that we have had
                    thoughts of quitting the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the negroes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual succours
                    arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The greater part of the colonists,
                    this day, assembled at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers, who were in
                    the fort of Trinity, with twenty three officers of the regiment, were
                    glad to make their escape.– There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon,
                    many of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and other colonies, an
                    supposed to have been sent by Martinico refugees.–The firing of
                    cannon is heard incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder will
                    soon be consumed.</p>
         <p>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been obliged to promise and sign
                    whatever the insurgents have been please to dictate.–The
                    soldiers run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to give them
                    money.–Imagine, in short, a scene of confusion and terror, and you
                    will then have some idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal.</p>
         <p>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, who come here from all parts.
                    M. Chabrol, Colonel of the regiment which has been sent here,
                    together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been appointed comandant o
                    the NAtional troops.</p>
         <p>The women, confident that it is in his power to re-establish tranquility,
                    prostrate themselves before him, strew the ground on which he
                    walks with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.– He seems
                    willing to comply with their wishes.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne guarded by an army of 4000 men,
                    under the command of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General.</p>
         <p>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming four privateers with which
                    they mean to attack Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate
                    among them, but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from Dublin, Nov.23.</p>
         <p>"The drafts at Cork yesterday received the agreeable orders to
                    return to their respective regiments immediately.</p>
         <p>"The officers appointed to raise independent companies in Ireland, have
                    received orders to repair forthwith to England, with whatever
                        complement of men already entered, but not to proceed
                    with the completion of their number : in conference to this order, they are
                    preparing for their immediate departure.</p>
         <p>"Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of this city received orders, by way of
                    a vessel arrived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez and
                    Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation of cotton, white linen, and
                    mixed goods, to a very large amount.</p>
         <p>"Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, Mark Purcell, master, arrived at
                    Waterford from Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dangerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had nearly exhausted the whole
                    of their provisions, having been a very short allowance of half a
                    naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad water, for
                    twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, having on board six hundread
                    hogsheads of tobacco, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel
                    hoops, &amp;c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per
                    cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo, but refused, on account of
                    the then probability of a war."</p>

            <pb n="2"/> The Indian ships lately returned from Madras and Bengal, gives
                    unfavourable accounts of all the branches of commerce, except that of
                    matrimony, which has succeeded wonderfully in the last femaleexportations. Out of eleven ladies, who embarked

                    Captain Burgess, nine were connubially linked to
                    weakly husbands within three months after their arrival and the other
                    two were left in a way to complete this fortunate band of hymeneal adventu-rers.</p>

      <text>
         <p>THE INDIANS.</p>
         <p> IT is our wish, in imitation of other newswritters, to give now
                    and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of
                    the public; but in a paper, published only twice a week, where so much
                    naturally occurs under the article of temporary news, it is but seldom we
                    can find room for this purpose:–when, however, any
                    ting remarkable appears in the literary world, we never fail to notice it,
                    although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real
                    pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy,
                    intitled THE INDIANS, the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this
                        University. The great applause with which this play was
                    received, when performed at Richmond Theatre, has raised the expectations
                    of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert,
                    that upon perusing it, even their highest expetations will not be
                    disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known
                    story published at the end of a volum of poems, written by the same
                    gentleman. In the choice of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred, our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace:</p>
         <p>Denique sit quid vis, simplex dumtaxat et
                            unum.</p>
         <p>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of
                    nakedness.–It is one, for the complaints of Maraino, and
                    the return of Oniyo, form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and
                    Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts, an
                    end, which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In
                    the delineation of character the author has, on alevery occasion, attended to the "quid quemquedecent"–there are hoever some few parts,
                    which the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so many beauties,
                    he blushes to censure–Some lines, for instance in the character of
                    Ononthio, do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much
                    humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, as to prompt him to
                    spare a victim, about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the
                    country; that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but a Briton,
                    who has been fighting against his countrymen, amongst whom was
                    his only son, whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in
                    favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of displeasing the
                    village, and consequently of losing his power? Or is it likely that he
                    would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd, than he,
                    who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the
                    fortune of mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with the philosophic firmness
                    of the Sachem, so to despair on receiving news of his son's
                    death, as to declare that he should know no comfort, but to die? or is
                    it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of
                    distress, when she most stood in need of his kind offices?–The
                    first, and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino.
                    Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful
                    reverence of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her humanity, in interfering to save an unknown captive from death, are pleasing
                        ??? which give ???an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every
                    thing is subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her
                    caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But
                    even in this master-piece the author, has, perhaps, once deviated a little
                    from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather those of a Phiosopher
                    and Divine, than a young creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to
                    the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she, who had lately
                    discovered a long lost brother, talk so coldly in his presence; Can she,
                    who had so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, so
                    entirely banish his image from her mind, as to converse on matters so
                    indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold
                    moralist?–With this one exception, the part of which we are speaking
                    is finely drawn and highly interesting.–The language
                    of the piece is every where elegant, and in many places, where the
                    sentiment requires it, sublime. The author has frequently dignified his
                    verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces
                    a good effect–but there is a danger of using them too often, and of
                    chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where
                    all is so excellent, to refer to any particular passage of scene
                    as deserving most notice: it requires no small degree of taste and
                    judgement. If there is any preference to be given, it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo gives an account of the
                    battle at Quebec; and the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves his
                    innocence by the production of her husband's belt, the sight of which draws
                    an elegant speech from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, would
                    be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the
                    joyful moment, than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech
                    excellent in itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, Sed nunc non erat his
                        locus.–</p>
         <p>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we have, guided by impartiality,
                    spoken so freely, is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays
                    which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid of
                    bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably
                    please.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, says that the Indians in
                    Washington county commit the most horrid depredations and
                    cruelties. They have set fire to several houses; and a woman, who had a sick husband, telling them from a window, of her calamity,
                    they shot her dead on the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick
                    man was consequently burnt.</p>
         <p>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing
                    the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman, with two hundred men, even went into the very heart of an Indian
                    settlement, and defeated the savages. He then penetrated the country,
                    destroying all before him, and returned without the loss of a man.
                    Every possible acknowledgement was made of his services and
                    bravery, and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little
                    army.</p>

      <text>
         <p>QUEBEC, December 2, 1790 Yesterday's post from
                    Montreal, conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town, all
                        corroboratiing the following extract.</p>
         <p>"SIR, "I have to inform you by several letters
                        received here on Saturday from Detroit, "we are
                    informed the Americans, under General Sinclair, had been twice
                    defeated, about the 19th ult. with the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the
                    Indians The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse which they had
                    drawn into a snare, and cut the whole of them off. In a second engagement,
                    they were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as many. On
                    account of which, Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts
                    state the Indians having divided themselves into small parties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to leave the wounded in
                    the field–Sinclair lost his artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper.
                    It is said the Indians are very much elated at their success, and that
                    numbers were daily joining them, at their head quarters, about the Maimis
                    towns– One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own hand.</p>
         <p>"The Indians were extremely civil to the traders from Detriot, having
                    assisted them, when they knew of the approach of the Americans, to
                    remove their property to safety, except ammunition and
                    arms. These are facts so well ascertained, that there does not
                    remain the least doubt of them:</p>
         <p>They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the
                    province, as I dare say, all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.– In
                    short, I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising, to
                    attack this country. * The loss is here specified, but other letters
                    differing in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general does
                    not appear considerable.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Longevity.–At Taconey, a small village about
                    seven miles from Philadelphia, there is now living a shoemaker of the
                    name of Robert Glen, who in December last attained the great age of one hun-dred and fourteen years. Scotland was the
                    place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and
                    was present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his
                    memory nor his sight, are in the least impaired; and such is his
                    strength, that after working all the week at his profession, he
                    regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia, and back. His third
                    wife is now living, and is not more than thirty years old.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/> CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
         <p>The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a
                    late traveller.</p>
         <p>The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government
                    never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his
                    sons, by writing and accounts, to become servants of the
                    Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their
                    employ, who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were
                    sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it tacitly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of
                    such a conduct was, that each became a kind of petty dealer.
                    Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house.
                    The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities
                    for sale ; and those who ranked high in government, and assumed a
                    string of full-founding epithets to their names, felt no sore of indignity
                    in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but
                    through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds of every class,
                    the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, and the Secretary of the Court of
                    Justice excepted, were wholly bent on trade. Knopman, or merchant, was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to
                    which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the
                    Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese, who have degraded
                    the merchant into the very lowest order of their society.</p>
         <p>That portion of the day, not employed in the concerns of trade, is usually
                    devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have
                    any taste for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine
                    arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, except occasional
                    balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which
                    usually consist of card playing or dancing. Money-matters
                    and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are
                    opulent, though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the
                    whole colony, and but a few who are objects of public charity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund
                    established out of the church superfluities, from alms,
                    donations, and collections, made after divine service, and not from any tax
                    laid upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial assessments for
                    the repairs of the streets and public works, the inhabitants of the Cape
                    have little drawback on their profits, on the produce of their
                    labour.</p>
         <p>It has been the remark of most travellers, that the ladies of the Cape are
                    pretty, lively, and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic
                        temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and
                    appearance of the young men and the young women, in the same family, is
                    inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in
                    in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter
                    are generally of a small, delicate form, below the middle size, of easy and
                    unaffected manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; an
                    indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents, and which
                    they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on,
                    and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else where.
                    Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children, male and
                    female, share alike in the family property. No parent can disinherit a
                    child without assigning, on proof, on at least of the fourteen reasons
                    enumerated in the Justinian Code.</p>
         <p>By the law of the colony, a community of all property, both real and
                    personal, is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless
                    the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn
                    contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists, the children,
                    on the death of either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint
                    property, which was supposed to belong to the deceased, and
                    which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of
                    age.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="4"/>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark, that many of
                    them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited
                    means of education that the place affords. In the better families,
                    most of them are taught music, and some have acquired a tolerable degree of
                    execution. Many understand the French language, and some have made
                    great proficiency in the English. They  are expert at the needle, and
                    all kinds of lace, knotting, and tambour work, and in general
                    make up their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion of England
                    brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to India, from
                    whom they may be said to "Catch the manners living
                        as they rise"</p>
         <p>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient in vivacity or talent ;
                    but, for want of the means of a proper education, to open their minds, and
                    excite in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degenerate
                    into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], and sleeping. Few of the
                    male inhabitants associate with the English, except such as hold
                    employments under the Government. This backwardness may be said to be
                    owing in part to the different habits of the two nations, and partly,
                    perhaps, to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always
                    feel in mixing with their conquerors.</p>

      <header>As the following Speech...</header>
      <text>
         <p>As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the
                    Congress of the United States at New York, Nov. 6 1792, gives an
                    impartial account of the situation of tha country, we are
                    persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our
                    readers.</p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of
                        Representatives,</p>
         <p>IT is some abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the
                    present occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the
                    national prosperity, generally, I am not able to add to it information
                    that the Indian hostilities, which have for some time past, distressed our
                    western frontier, have terminated:</p>
         <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern, than I communicate
                    it, that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have
                    hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering
                    hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest
                    desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the
                    further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of
                    expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation, for peace, has
                    led to strenuous efforts, through various channels, to accomplish these
                        desirable purposes:–In making which efforts, I
                    consulted less my own anticipations of the event, or the scruples
                    which some considerations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find
                    the object attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, that
                    such is the case.</p>
         <p>A detail of the measures which have been pursued, and of their
                    consequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you
                    the want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince that means, as
                    proper and as efficacious, as could have been devised have been employed.
                    The issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; but a favorable
                    one, though not to be despaired of, is not promised by anything that has
                    yet happened.</p>
         <p>In the course of the attempts, which have been made some valuable citizens
                    have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction
                    commonly respected, even among savages, has been found, in this
                    instance, insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it
                    will, I presume, be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an
                    exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.</p>
         <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed that besides the continuation of
                    hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of
                    those south of it.</p>
         <p>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five
                    villages on the Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of
                    committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.</p>
         <p>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made with the Cherokee Nation in
                    July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But
                    the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas, aided by some
                    banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated
                    wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the citizens of the
                    United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on
                    this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed.</p>
         <p>It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever, on
                    the part of the United States or their citizens, is even
                    alleged, as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.</p>
         <p>I have reason to believe, that every practicable exertion has been made
                    (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for
                    the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the event of a failure
                    of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be
                    raised have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and
                    pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition
                    for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of
                    operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing
                    towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself
                    deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement, from the
                    proper department, with regard to the number of troops raised, and
                    some other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and
                    among other things, will enable Congress to judge whether some additional
                    stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.</p>
         <p>In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be
                    found inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive
                    that the product of the revenues for the present year, is likely to
                    supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community,
                    for the service of the ensuing year. This however, will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is
                    proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds upon the
                    supposition of no material extension of the spirit of
                    hostilities.</p>
         <p>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending
                    to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision
                    for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior
                    frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians;
                    without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by
                    competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons to
                    reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of
                    peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients, an
                    eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the
                    friendly tribes, and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale
                    equal to their wants, and under regulations calculated to
                    protect them from imposition and extortion, its influence in
                    cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.</p>
         <p>The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be
                    still more the case, were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits,
                    distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened, and
                    are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at
                    large, the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.</p>
         <p>But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in
                    certain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part, proper
                    and advisable, and under this impression have issued a proclamation
                    warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings,
                    having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the
                    law in question, and announcing that all lawful ways and means
                    would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the
                    infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.</p>
         <p>Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders.
                    And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal
                    limits which may depend upon me, shall be wanting to assert
                    and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I
                    shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of
                    the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.</p>
         <p>I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the
                    subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the
                        judges of the supreme court, which will be laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences that are
                    experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws
                    considerations rise out of the structure of the system, which in some
                    cases, tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject,
                    provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the
                    courts of the United States, and a supplementary definition of offenses
                    against the constitution and laws of the union, and of the punishment
                    for such offenses will, it is presumed, be found worthy of
                    particular attention.</p>
         <p>Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It
                    would be wise, however, by timely provisions to guard against
                    those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb
                    it, and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to
                    foreign nations, which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them.
                    I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of
                    preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other
                    nations, and other infractions of the law of nations, which furnishes
                    just subject of complaint, might endanger our peace with them.
                    And, in general, the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign
                    powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the
                    law for that purpose, which takes place, if not renewed, at the close of
                    the present session.</p>
         <p>In execution of the authority given by the legislature, measures
                    have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the
                        establishment of our mint; others have been employed at
                    home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings, and these
                    are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the
                    establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.</p>
         <p>The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the
                    principles of our national coinage, as being essential to their due
                    operation, and to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be
                    resumed and completed.</p>
         <p>It is represented that some provisions in the law, which establishes the
                    Post-Office, operate, in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this,
                    upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the
                    importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and
                        infor</p>
         <p>mation, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.</p>
         <p>The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky, has been notified
                    to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction
                    which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of
                    the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order.</p>
         <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the
                    subject, and in further execution of the acts, severally making
                    provision for the public debt, and for the reduction
                    thereof, three new loans have been effected, each for three millions of
                    florins,–one at Antwerp, at the annual interest of four
                    and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of
                    all charges.–The rates of these loans, and the circumstances under
                    which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our
                    credit abroad.</p>
         <p>Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the
                    payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to the
                    provision made during the last session, has been embraced.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the national finances is now
                    sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the
                    public debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the
                    government –no measure can be more desirable, whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to the
                    general sentiment and wish of the nation.</p>
         <p>Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan
                    which has been made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the
                        section of the act by which it is incorporated. In
                    fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, it is expected a
                    valuable saving will be made.</p>
         <p>Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and
                    for such extraordinaries as may require provision, will demand, and I doubt
                    not will engage, your early attention.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of
                        Representatives,</p>
         <p>I content myself with recalling your attention, generally to such objects,
                    not particularized in my present, as have been suggested in my former
                    communications to you.</p>
         <p>Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these,
                    that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian
                    tribes, will merit particular notice.</p>
         <p>The results of your common deliberations hitherto will, I trust,
                    be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as,
                    by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage, will
                    tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment, upon which, under Divine
                    Providence, materially depend their union, their safety, and their
                    happiness.</p>
         <p>Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there
                    is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful
                        cultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to
                    stability, in the public councils.</p>

         <p>We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the
                    Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of
                    Penn sylvania, prosecutions have been instituted against John Singleterry
                    and Gideon Henfield, charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the
                    United States, entering on board the armed schooner Genet,
                    in the service of France, and, with others on board the said schooner,
                    capturing several vessels, the property of the subjects of his Britannic
                        Majesty, and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said subjects, contrary to the Laws of
                    Nations, and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States
                    and his said Britannic Majesty.</p>
         <p>The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of

            <pb n="4"/> A great number of white people and white families have been
                    killed and scalped by the Indians in the back settlements of
                    America. Among the killed and scalped is Mr. Pugh, son of
                    Colonel Pugh.</p>
         <p>The Indians are determined on war with the Americans. They are headed by
                    Gilpin, the successor of M'Gillivray, and have already commenced hostilities on the back settlements of Carolina.</p>

            <pb n="5"/>Knoxville, May 11.</p>
         <p>IT is shocking to describe the bloody scenes
                    that have lately taken place in this district. The Indians have killed
                    and scalped a great number of persons, among whom is Colonel Isaac Bledose,
                    who was massacred within 150 yards of his own house.</p>
         <p>On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked Greenfield station: they
                    killed John Jervis, and a negro fellow, belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By
                    the bravery of three young men, viz. William Neely, William
                    Wilson, and William Hall, the station was preserved; they killed two
                    Indians, wounded several others, and put them to flight. It is to be
                    remembered, that Neely and Hall had each lost a father and two brothers,
                    and Wilson a brother, by the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indians.</p>
         <p>June 15.</p>
         <p>About the 5th instant, a company of seven men were attacked on the trace
                    from Cumberland to Kentucky, near Big Barren, by a party of Indians; three of the company were killed, and two wounded.</p>
         <p> AUGUSTA, June 15.Advices from our western frontiers mention, that Major General Twiggs
                    crossed the Oconnee with about 900 men, on Saturday last, on their way
                    to the Cakmulgee, where the infantry were to halt and build a fort. The
                    cavalry, amounting to 450, commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin,
                    Clark, and Blackburn, were immediately to proceed to the
                    lower Creek towns, and procure satisfaction for the numerous
                    unprovoked murders and devastations lately committed by that faithless
                    tribe of savages.</p>
         <p>Brigadier General Glascock, we are informed, has received orders from the
                    Commander in Chief to march to the frontiers in a few days, with one-
                    third of his brigade, and part of the Augusta artillery.

      <text>
         <p>At four o'clock yesterday morning Mess. Muir, Skirving, and Margarot,
                    were taken from their beds, without any previous notice, hand-cuffed, and put into a post-chaise, to be conveyed to
                    Woolwich, where a vessel waits to sail with them immediately for
                    Botany Bay.</p>
         <p>Mr. Palmer has, we understood, been sent from on board the hulks, in the
                    same manner, to take his passage on board the same vessel.</p>
         <p>Between 10 and 11 o'clock, about sixty female convicts were put on board a
                    vessel at Blackfriars bridge, destined to the same voyage. These latter
                    behaved in a most turbulent manner and even fought in the hold of the
                    boat. There were among them one or two well dressed women ; and what
                    was more lamentable in the eyes of the spectator, some of had infants
                    with them.</p>

      <header>New South WalesThe following...</header>
      <text>
         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>The following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will
                    not be unacceptable to our readers :–</p>
         <p>"We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, who is lately arrived from New South
                    Wales, of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson
                    in November last, when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be
                    cut down, without having suffered that year from the floods.</p>
         <p>"Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite, for the
                    purpose of supplying the colony with pork, in which he had been
                    singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise having made
                    one trip, and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous
                    to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney.</p>
         <p>"The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of
                    Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to
                    hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity,
                    the article of coals, of an excellent kind, being found in abundance in
                    Hunter's River, together with plenty of wood, well qualified for the
                    masting of shipping. Mr Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good
                    Hope, round Cape Horn, in the brig Anna Josepha, loaded
                    with spars for masts, and coals, which latter sold immediately at the Cape,
                    at 36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.)</p>
         <p>"Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River,
                    for the purpose of working the coal, which is of the same nature
                    with that of Newcastle.</p>
         <p>"Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson, in order to obtain the
                    survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the
                    same, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Paterson, without being able at
                    that time, to discover its source. A wood resembling sustic had also been found.</p>
         <p>"Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson, in the Lady Nelson, a
                    vessel of only 60 tons burthen, with three sliding keels, and built on
                    Captain Schank's construction, was the first that passed through the
                    straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland,
                    and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land
                    before seen by those who had visited that country, going into no higher
                    latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes, that the fourth cape of
                    New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold,
                    with very deep water, wherever he attempted to land ; and, in general,
                    he had, with a very moderate offing, from 50 10 45, and 30
                    fathoms water, fine land, and sometimes shells.</p>
         <p>"By order of Governor King, he returned into those straits, and obtained the
                    survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port, with the
                    survey of that harbour, which is well sheltered, and capable of containing
                    many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got,
                    and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured,
                    on account of the distance, and from several shoals lying
                    in the way, which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant
                    gives a very favourable report of that part of the country.</p>

         <p>CanadaExtract of a letter from a Gentleman, to his Friend in
                        Glasgow</p>
         <p>"Quebec, March 23, 1810.–A number of
                    leading characters among the Canadians, who were Members of the House
                    of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the
                    proprietor of a French paper, called La Canadien,
                    have been arrested and thrown into jail, upon a charge of
                        treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press,
                    types, &amp;c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Canadians not a
                    little, but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country, as
                    it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining
                    strength, and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the
                    inhabitants, who are without education, and ignorant, of course, in the
                    extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen, who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those
                    prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the
                    British : for, having been allowed to preserve their language, they are
                    nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest."</p>
         <p>Quebec, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the
                    printer of the Canadien, Mr Charles Lafrancois
                    was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant from the Executive
                    Council, on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday
                    evening, Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau,
                    were also arrested, and committed by the same authority on
                    the same charges.</p>
         <p>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner, at
                    head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's
                    birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry, Generals,
                    and Field-Officers of the army, were present.</p>
         <p>Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day, from the
                    imprudent use of gunpowder, is the death of girl in Richmond
                    Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, although immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so severely burnt, that
                    she died before morning.</p>
         <p>A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease,
                    Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire
                    militia was stopping there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging
                    to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and was climbing on the
                    wheel, when the horses suddengoing off, threw him on the ground,
                    and the wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. The
                    unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident
                    happened.</p>
         <p>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, Glasgow, was broken into
                    and about five pounds in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight
                    shillings of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments
                    are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by
                    forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then breaking a
                    pane of glass, by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened.</p>
         <p>On Saturday last, a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee
                    harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron
                        pully was supported, giving way, the measure fell down
                    upon him, and killed him instantly.</p>
         <p>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Stevenson, was killed by
                    the blowing up of some stones, at Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse.
                    The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder, and the
                    explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife
                    and two children to lament his loss.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Montreal, July 4</p>
         <p>This city has been for a few days past in a state of agitation occasioned by
                    an event which has taken place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will
                    be clothed, no doubt, in all the dress of misrepresentatation by our neighbouring enemies, from the information they
                    may receive of it, we consider it a duty, we owe to the community at large
                    in this country, to state the circumstances as they occurred, in a fair,
                    open, and candid manner.</p>
         <p>By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be drafted from the general
                    militia of the province for three months to be properly trained, and of
                    course, a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished by each
                    particular district. Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire
                    refused to march to Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the division
                        stationed there ; in consequence of which, Major, Leprohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent on
                    Tuesday last, with 22 attendants, to apprehend these refractory persons as
                    deserters.</p>
         <p>They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with
                    them, they were followed by a considerable number of persons who
                    rescued one prisoner, and threatened that they would next day proceed
                    to the depot at Lapraire, and bring away by force from thence the young men
                    of the parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on Wednesday, a
                    large body of these people assembled at La Chine, with the intention of
                    carrying their threats into execution.</p>
         <p>Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magistrates, about four
                    o'clock in the afternoon, left town, accompanied by the light infantry of
                    the 49th regiment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with
                    two field-pieces, under the command of Major Plenderleath, and took
                    post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400
                    persons, 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of
                    about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other respectable citizens, pointed
                    out the impropriety of their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately
                    await their perseverance ; urging them, by every persuasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the
                    law.</p>
         <p>They replied, that they did not consider the militia bill as
                    fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal
                    sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of
                        Assembly, where it originated, it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the
                    law, if really enacted, had not been promagated amongst them,
                    and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such, they
                    could not pay obedience to it.</p>
         <p>Under this false and unfortunate impression, these deluded people persisted
                    ; but at the same time declared, with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted
                    their services at any time, they were ready, one and all, to come forward
                    with their lives in the defence of their country, and that they would
                    prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful subjects to a
                    Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle.</p>
         <p>Finding, however, that they still persisted in their determination on this
                    particular object, Mr M'Cord, in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot
                    act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, but
                    elevated above injury, which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited
                    fire with ball, deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley
                    with ball and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm which
                    was also returned by another discharge from the mob, upon which a few
                    direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military,
                    which made them disperse, and one man was found killed and another
                    wounded, it is feared mortally.</p>

      <header>Upper CanadaYork, July, 28 Yesterday,...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Upper CanadaYork, July, 28.</p>
         <p>Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac Brock, Esq. administering the
                    Government of Upper Canada, and Major-General, commanding his
                    Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from Fort-George, and
                    accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at
                    four p.m.when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature, and delivered the following speech to both houses
                    :–</p>
         <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council and Gentlemen of the House
                    of Assembly,</p>
         <p>"The urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration
                    which would have induced me to call you together, at a time when public as
                    well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention.</p>
         <p>"But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire
                    conquest of this province, the voice of loyalty, as well as of interest,
                    calls aloud to every person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend
                    his country.</p>
         <p>"Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced,
                    by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct, that they are worthy of
                    the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it
                    affords me particular satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legislators, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be
                    ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their
                    arms.</p>
         <p>"We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the regular forces, for
                    our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed
                    to my care, if I attempted to conceal (what experience, the great
                    instructor of mankind, especially of legislators, has discovered) that
                    amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is
                    for you to consider what further improvements they still may
                    require.</p>
         <p>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the House
                    of Assembly,</p>
         <p>"From the history and experience of our mother country, we learn, that in
                    times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary
                    course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's
                    Government from private treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and
                    that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws
                        restraining, for a limited period, the liberty of
                    individuals, in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the
                        particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion
                    of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.</p>
         <p>"A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to
                    come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and
                    concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears
                    to pervade the inhabitants of this province, is such as to authorise a just
                    expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be
                    unavailing– The disaffected, I am convinced, are few–To
                    protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations."</p>
         <p>The speech concludes with a call for supplies.</p>
         <p>Proclamation</p>
         <p>The unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America, against
                    the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has
                    been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote
                    frontier of the western districts, by a detachment of the United States.
                    The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to
                        invite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and
                    unresisting submission, but insults them with a call to seek
                    voluntarily the protection of his Government.</p>
         <p>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this
                    appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the
                    administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of the province is
                    desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of
                    his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has been
                    injured by the Government in his person, his property, or his liberty?
                    Where is to be found, in any part of the world, a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not
                    thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from their former possessions on
                    account of their loyalty, not a descendant of these brave people it to be
                    found, who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, has not
                    acquired a property and means of enjoyment, superior to what were possessed
                    by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government, or the
                    persevering industry of the people, had not the maritime power of the
                    mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where
                    the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and
                    immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain, must
                    be the loss of this inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in
                    exchange? To become a territory of the United States, and share with
                    them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government
                        enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too
                    obvious, that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the
                    United Kingdom, you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France, from
                    which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great
                    Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure, from no other motive than to
                    relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel
                    neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France, was the
                    stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies,
                    now the United States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no
                    doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration
                    for commercial advantages, or rather for an expected relaxation in the
                    tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabitants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or rather
                    slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If
                    not, arise in a body, exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the
                    King's regular forces, to repel the invader, and do not give cause to
                    your children, when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master, to
                    reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name,
                    character, and freedom of Britain.</p>
         <p>[The proclamation concludes with a declaration, that should the Americans
                    refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in
                    Canadian ranks, that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take
                    place.]</p>
         <p>Isaac Brock, Major-Gen. and President
                    Head-quarters, Fort George, July 22, 1812.</p>

         <p>Provincial Parliament of Lower CanadaLegislative Council–Aug 1.</p>
         <p>This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the
                    usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber, and being seated on
                    the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command
                    the presence of the Assembly, which being come up, the
                    Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said–</p>
         <p>"May it please your Excellency,</p>
         <p>"His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of the province of
                    Lower Canada, have passed a bill, intituled, "An Act of facilitate the
                    Circulation of Army Bills." Their loyalty, and the happiness of this
                    province in being connected with, and powerfully protected by the British
                    nation, are the basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which
                    gave rise to the formation of the militia, and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust
                    war that the United States have lately declared ; they are, therefore,
                    under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to

                    several years, the punctual payment of the army, by circulating bills, the
                        reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give
                    them greater credit, the bill limits the sums necessary, and, moreover, provides for the interest, the advantages accruing
                        therefrom, and even for the payment of the principal in
                    specie in this province, which has become expressly bound for the same
                    at a fixed period, to any person whatever, who, from the state of his

         <p>War in Canada</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25</p>
         <p>"Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his
                    way he passed three days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the American army, which, from ocular observation, he states to
                    consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command of General Bloomfield, Mooar,
                    and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the
                    same number of militia, and some volunteers from the southward. The
                    militia is almost all from the state of New York, for the Yankees still
                    refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but
                    theywill make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season,
                    they must be prompt in their movements, for the weather is getting cold,
                    and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states
                    half of them to be without shoes or stockings, which will never do for
                    a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack, we are
                    making every preparation in our power, and the Canadians
                    seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost
                    has established a cordon, the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to
                    Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St
                    John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ;
                    and the Isle-au Noix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a
                    chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of
                    four regiments of the line, and 2000 drafted militia, with a corps of about
                    400 Canadian voltigeurs, raised last spring. The Royals, a very strong
                    battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, are now marching to join
                    the camp. The citizens, both here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do
                    garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions
                    of militia, say 3 to 4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an
                    alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment
                    of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the
                    different regiments of inrolled militia in this island, and old
                    Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen
                    of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs, who
                    will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The
                    number originally proposed was 200, but the men have come forward so
                    handsomely, that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is
                        Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major,
                    and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so
                    that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey,
                    may be considered as already disciplined, at least in point of
                    subordination.</p>
         <p>"Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte,
                    with about 70 Indians, advanced through the woods, about ten days ago,
                    within hearing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop,
                    which so completely terrified them that though they could see no
                    enemy, they lay on their arms for two two successive nights, in no
                    expectation of an attack–to prevent which, they cut down their best
                    bridge, and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to
                    invade us. Mr –, who was several days at their headquarters, and who
                    was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said,
                        proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500
                    men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his plan was fixed,
                    not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line.</p>
         <p>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness, tends only
                    to increase their insolent swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to
                    be allayed by any thing but hard knocks."</p>

      <header>CanadaThe Rota frigate arrived...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>The Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth, with a fleet
                    from Halifax under convoy, and passed up the channel with the chief part of
                    the trade. From the Hydra transport, which put into Plymouth, we have
                    received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on
                    Lake Ontario, the American notices of which have already been
                    published.</p>
         <p>Bulletin.</p>
         <p>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 "By accounts received from his
                    Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, from
                    Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, half-past one P.M. on the 11th
                    instant, the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and
                    loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–</p>
         <p>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, the enemy's squadron, under the
                    Command of Commodore Chauncey, got under weigh from their anchorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with a fine
                    breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, which were becalmed off the
                    port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land,
                    gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron stood for them, on
                    which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners
                    could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet
                    formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, and six schooners (two schooners
                    were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our
                    squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within
                    gun-shot of the schooners, when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their
                    going so fast, it was more than an hour before the Wolf, our headmost
                    ship, could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and
                    three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming up with the Madison
                    and Pike, they put before the wind and made sail, firing their
                    stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only ship which
                    could keep up with them, then made sail between them and the two schooners
                    to wind ward, which he captured, and which are called the
                    Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32 pounder and long
                    12-pounder, and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the
                    Scourge, of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the night of the
                    9th, in carrying sail, and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By
                    this loss and capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels,
                    and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike
                    mounts 28 long 24-pounders, and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders,
                    and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's
                    squadron on Monday last, for the purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the
                    boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury, and
                    not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant, and
                    the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit, and
                    was otherwise cut up.</p>
         <p>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the
                    officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement."</p>

         <p>Canada.(From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort
                        Schlosser.Head-quarters, Kingston, July 13.</p>
         <p>By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg, dated the 9th
                    instant, the following particulars have been received of a bold and
                        successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort
                    Schlosser.</p>
         <p>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting of Volunteer Thompson
                    and six privates of the 49th regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four
                    of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieutenant
                    Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, crossed over in boats
                    from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, which they reached a little before
                    day-break, and completely surprised the guard, consisting of two
                    Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom they made
                    prisoners, together with three civilians and three of our own subjects,
                    found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour,
                    loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, and brought with
                    them one brass six-pounder, 57 stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket
                    ball cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats, one
                    gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels
                    of pork, and one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, oars, and
                    axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed
                    off from the shore, and several shots were fired, but the boats returned
                    to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles they had captured,
                    without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been
                    received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party of the King's
                    regiment, and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour
                    to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical
                    instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops
                    retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and
                    the enemy, in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the
                    King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded.
                    Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit
                    is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for
                    reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited, and
                    conducting the party to it.</p>
         <p>A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats, and
                    more than 100 barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought away
                    from thence, together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced
                    and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour, being destroyed.</p>
         <p>Attack on Black RockHead-quarters, Kingston, July 15 1813.</p>
         <p>G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a
                    dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg, reporting a successful attack
                    upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the
                    King's and 41st regiments, together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of
                    the 49th, and about 40 militia, the whole amounting to 240 men, under
                    the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried
                    by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several
                    large boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three field
                    pieces, a twelve and two six-pounders, were brought away ; a vessel and all
                    the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt.</p>
         <p>Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed, a strong
                    reinforcement of the enemy, aided by Indians, pressed this small
                    detachment, by which Captain Saunders, of the 41st, and 15 men, were
                    killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp, Lieutenant Montpesson, of the 41st,
                    and 15 rank and file, wound ed. The wounded were brought over.</p>
         <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds, severe, but not
                    considered dangerous.</p>
         <p>By his Excellency's command,</p>

         <p>British Expedition to Plattsburgh</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a respectable
                    citizen at Burlington, dated Aug. 1. 1813</p>
         <p>"An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July, with intelligence that
                    the British had left the Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two
                        armed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one
                    gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had progressed within one
                    mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed, and the troops under
                    arms, but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000
                    troops, under the command of Colonel Murray, had landed, and took
                    possession of Plattsburgh without opposition, there being no
                    force to oppose them except the militia of the town and
                    vicinity, who being only 400 in number, retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, Pike's encampment,
                    barracks at Serenac cantonment, and every building belonging to the United
                    States, were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and
                    stores. The loss cannot be less than 50,000 dollars. The enemy left
                    Plattsburgh on the 1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way

                    Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans.</p>
         <p>General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June,
                    on account of indisposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch
                    to Secretary at War, that he did not think the General
                    would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the
                    war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes
                    in a state of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to
                    command at Sacket's Harbour, is succeeded at Fort George,
                    Niagara, and on the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd.</p>
         <p>The Indian chief, Tecumseh, has seized the favourable moment of
                    the diversion by our shipping in Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with
                    2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who commanded there, had
                    written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was
                    collecting his army to march to his relief.</p>
         <p>Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George, swept
                    the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great
                    Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, consisting of
                    several hundred barrels of pork and flour, and burnt the buildings. The
                    British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At
                    Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the enemy, taking 500
                    barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to
                    General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked
                    on board the fleet, to serve as mariners</p>
         <p>There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 American prisoners of war,
                    captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort
                    there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the
                    conduct of the American Government and of the officers, the latter are no
                    longer permitted to return home on parole. The Melpomene
                    frigate, with De Meuron's regiment, from the Mediterranean, arrived in
                    the river St. Lawrence on the 20th July.</p>
         <p>James Gready, private in the 8th, or King's regiment, and Terence
                    Hunt, private in the 6th foot, were in the latter end of June, tried by
                    Court Martials, for deserting to the enemy, and being found in
                    arms, and were publicy shot at Kingston, Canada, pursuant to their
                    sentence.</p>
         <p>It appears from the Quebec papers, and from the general orders issued by the
                    Commander in Chief in Canada that on the late defeat of General Wilkinson on the banks of the Miami river, the American military
                    chest, containing 15,000l. Sterling was among the property
                    captured by the British.</p>
         <p>Captain Waugh, of the 103d regiment, died at Chamely on the 2d July.</p>
         <p>General Hampton has arrested Colonel Clark, the late commandant at
                    Burlington, for a defalcation of about 50,000 dollars.</p>

         <p>Victory in Canada</p>
         <p>By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sunday last, at
                    Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage of 36 days, papers and letters have
                    been received from Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an
                    engagement between a detachment of the British force under Lieut.-Col.
                    Morrison, consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies
                    of the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, amounting to
                    4000 men, which ended in the defeat of the latter, with great loss. This
                    action was produced by the attempt of the American General to
                    advance to Montreal, from which it appears, however, he has
                    now begun to measure back his steps, having crossed to the American side of
                    the river where the action was fought, and being actively pursued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
         <p>The following information has been received by the Alexander, Captain Henry,
                    which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:–</p>
         <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 "The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men,
                    under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by
                    General Boyd, consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c.
                    was alone engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
         <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston,
                    killed–probably 600 men killed, wounded, and taken.</p>
         <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at
                    Cornwall on the 13th, and evacuating the province. General
                    Wilkinson marched his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh,
                    leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon river, where they
                    were frozen in on the 16th, and 2000 men to protect them."</p>
         <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, with dispatches.</p>

         <p>Destruction of a Moravian Settlement in
                            Canada</p>
         <p>The following letter received in town, gives a description of the
                    wanton and barbarous conduct of the American army, in destroying a
                    settlement of the Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into
                    province:–</p>
         <p>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North America, by a
                    letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, concerning a report of the total
                    destruction of our settlement, ???
                        ??? on the 6th of October, by the American army under
                    General Harrison. It was the consequence of the invasion of that province,
                    after the capture of the little fleet on Lake Erie, and the defeat of the
                    s[?]al British force under the [?] of occupying the Chapel and some other
                    houses for our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the
                        Christian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans,
                    it was his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation
                    should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans were
                    successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps of effect it.
                    The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, and offered to purchase
                    the houses and cottages, but their defeat prevented it. On
                    entering the place, the Americans first pretended to be friendly, and sorry
                    that the Indians had fled, who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the
                        Missionaries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged
                        Missionary, Michael Young, remained.</p>
         <p>"During the first night the Americans already changed their tone, or rather
                    showed their real character. They began to abuse the Missionaries with
                    curses, and all manner of insults, plundering the houses ; and General
                    Harrison, to whom we appealed, would grant no redress. They took
                    every thing that was ??? away ;
                    and, under a pretence that King's stores and English goods were lodged in
                    the houses, ransacked every place, and every trunk and chest belonging to
                    individuals. Commodore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito
                    fleet on the lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest,
                        advicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could.
                    They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans set the
                    place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every outhouse[?]. The poor
                    Missionaries had a very tedious journey, and reached Silitiz, a settlement
                    of the Brethren in Pennsylvania, December 11. Whither the
                    Christian Indians have fled is not known ; they had proposed to go to the
                    Grand River, about 100 miles off.</p>

         <p>A proclamation, issued by Governor Macquarrie, appears in the Sidney Gazette
                    of 14th May, stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at
                    Port Dalrymple, Van Dieman's Land, and George Williams, Acting Deputy
                        Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement,
                    had absconded from their habitations, and fled to the woods ; that
                    their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they
                    had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes,
                    with whose aid they had committed numerous
                    robberies–entering the lands of settlers, driving away their cattle,
                    and plundering their houses. The proclamation declares that those who shall
                    return to their houses and occupations before 1st December next,
                    shall be pardoned and saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of
                    wilful murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, as
                    outlaws.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, Jan. 4. The Argo has arrived with a most extensive
                    supply of tea, viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson
                    skin, and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has
                    been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per lb
                    currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the Island of
                    Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea and sundies, valued at
                    L80,000, was captured by his Majesty's sloop Harpy, Captain
                    Allen.</p>
         <p>In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters of colonial and
                    British ships, and of their crews towards the natives of New Zealand, of
                    Otaheite, and of the other islands in the South Pacific Ocean, which have
                    led to the destruction of several vessels, with their crews, by the
                    natives, and disturbed all trade and intercourse with those
                    islands, both by British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his
                    Excellency has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New
                    South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to the naval
                    officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 sterling, binding him
                    and his crew not to commit any act of hostility, or to be guilty of any
                    trespass, or forment any animosities between the natives, or
                    take any part in any war that may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any
                    male or female inhabitants of the islands under penalty of
                    forfeiting the sum specified in the bond.</p>
         <p>A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land passage
                    in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of ascertaining the nature and fertility of the country, have discovered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence of which
                    one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already sent thither an extensive
                    herd of cattle, and this example is likely to be followed by others.</p>
         <p>Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, in the ship Earl
                    Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his Excellency a conditional
                    pardon, in consideration of his general good conduct and character for
                    sobriety and industry, and also in consideration of his having lately
                    erected a water mill for the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two
                    miles of Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty
                    of this town.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. The good understanding between the natives
                    and our settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years,
                    has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the
                    fields of a settler, when three privates of the veteran battalion fired
                    upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they
                    could load again, and killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the
                    other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse
                    and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers falling in with them, shot a
                    woman and two children–the savages attacked William Baker, a
                    stock-keeper of Mr MacArthur, killed the man and two women,
                    named Sullivan and Herburg.</p>
         <p>Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. On Monday last arrived the ship General
                    Hewett, Captain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the
                    46th regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday arrived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, having on board the
                    head-quarters of the 46th regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle,
                    who succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of
                    the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; also
                    Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports– Of the 300
                    convicts which the General Hewett received on board, 35 died on the
                    passage.</p>

         <p>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.]</p>
         <p>Quebec, July 15. The commercial world is flourishing here, but in
                    political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in the back ground.
                    The old defensive system is still adhered to, and, I fear much, with all
                    our reinforcements, we shall do little good till we have another
                    commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in
                    this country, and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost
                    sacrificed par lapetite guerre at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower
                        province, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing nothing.</p>
         <p>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France
                    do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments
                    the other day, our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly, that such systems
                    were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour
                    of serving very lately under a much more celebrated</p>
         <p>General that it was probable he would ever serve under
                    again–that his men had been accustomed to fight, not to dance ; and
                    if such was the plan he was called on to follow, he should certainly retire
                    from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing
                    to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men
                    amongst us, who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the
                    numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to.</p>
         <p>Montreal, July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure
                    against any attempts that the Americans may make, not withstanding the
                    system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great
                    many more troops this year than he had any idea of, and does not seem
                    pleased at having so large a force unhis command, as the country
                    will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy.
                    He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000
                    men at Chambly, where he makes them march past him twice a-week, bowing and
                    scraping, instead of employing them where they ought to be.</p>
         <p>You will have heard of an American army of about 6000, under General Jacob
                    Brown, having crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, with
                    a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by
                    numbers, and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general
                    order published yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby you
                    will find that our loss has been great.</p>
         <p>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force, and it appears very
                    singular indeed, that so great a body of men, as are now on the other side
                    of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at least 10,000 men, should
                    be left for the purpose of parade, when they are so much wanted in the
                    upper province.</p>
         <p>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business,
                    as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to
                    make an attack upon us with impunity.</p>

         <p>Private Correspondence</p>
         <p>Quebec, Sept. 10. The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and attacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th August. They
                    were repulsed by the British garrison.</p>
         <p>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken by the British. This
                    place was considered as of great importance to the enemy.</p>
         <p>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfortune to
                    break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer had just arrived to
                    join the army on the Niagara frontier, when he met with this accident.</p>
         <p>On the 31st August, the British troops broke their encampment at
                    Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and proceeded immediately to
                    take possession of the position which the American army had just abandoned
                    at the village of Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard,
                    and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and partly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British
                    troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Generals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 13th, 49, 88th,
                    Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>The 79th[?] or [?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quartered at
                    Cornwall, in Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are stationed at
                    Quebec.</p>
         <p>The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 100th, regiment
                    de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?]
                    companies are with the army under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the
                    Niagara frontier, Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal.</p>
         <p>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieutenant
                    General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack was made in three columns,
                    under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th
                    regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two
                    former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get
                    possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Americans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This latter column
                    failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the
                    fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, and obliged the enemy to
                    retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort, when their own guns
                    were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took
                    place, which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a number
                    of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great,
                    and we were obliged to abandon our conquest, and retreat to our original
                    position, with great loss of both officers and men.</p>
         <p>The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake Ontario is to be
                    launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100
                    guns.</p>
         <p>The battalion of royal marines, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
                    Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix, and parts
                    adjacent, have been broken up and distributed among the fleets
                    on the Lakes. The Staff of the battalion proceed immediately to
                    Halifax from Quebec, in the Ceylong armed-en [?] ship.</p>
         <p>The Junon frigate, Captain Upton, has arrived from Halifax at
                    Quebec, with money for Government. The crew of this vessel is to be
                    employed on the Lakes.</p>
         <p>A brig, which sailed from Cork, under convoy of the Antelope, of
                    50 guns, has arrived at Quebec.–The Antelope, and the ships under
                    convoy, are hourly expected. It is said that there are on board the ships
                    of the latter about 4000 troops, chiefly detachments and reinforcements for
                    the regimentsin Canada.</p>
         <p>Captain Dowale, of the royal navy, now commands the fleet on Lake
                    Champlain.</p>

         <p>Canada Papers</p>
         <p>Quebec, Sept. 3. The army from this province has entered the United States
                    by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was at
                    Chazy.</p>
         <p>Quebec, Sept. 8. From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs
                    M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, have
                    brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, at Michillimackinac,
                    written since the repulse of the American forces sent there to
                    recapture it. The following are the particulars of that expedition
                    :–</p>
         <p>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans landed 900 men, or
                    thereabouts, at the back of the island (Dowsman's farm). There is a
                    considerable space of ground cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled
                    their vessels, at anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant
                    fire of grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed
                    directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced towards the
                    woods.</p>
         <p>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison (150 at most) at
                    the extremity of the woods, and the Indians were stationed on each flank,
                    to keep the enemy from outflanking the troops. By a false
                    account of the enemy's intention to land on another part of the
                    island, a certain number of Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but
                    more Indians absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colonnel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was entertained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison
                    from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back
                    between the two forts, and there await the advance of the enemy.</p>
         <p>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left flank, and
                    ignorant of the movements in the centre and right flank, fired on the
                    Americans, and threw them into confusion, which the Indians soon perceived,
                    and encouraging each other by whoops and yells, totally broke the little
                    order still observed by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all
                    out of reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of their
                    retreat.</p>
         <p>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred men defeated and put
                    to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, with a loss of 17 men and a Major
                    (Holmes) killed and found on the spot!–The Indians lost but one
                    man."</p>
         <p>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by the enemy were
                    these:</p>
         <p>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent against
                    Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Mary's, where
                    they met with no resistance, there being neither troops nor Indians, and
                    every person occupied about their usual concerns ; such as bay making,
                    fishing &amp;c. Major Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to
                    indiscriminate plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging
                    to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, and vessels,
                    killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees prisoners ; tearing
                    down the fences, destroying the gardens, fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts
                    of cruelty might be detailed. Let two suffice for the present.</p>
         <p>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furniture ; the
                    very clothing of his wife and children was seized upon by these ruthless
                    plunderers, and carried away. Major Holmes sent to the south side of the
                    strait for Mr Johnstone's son George, and, after threatening and reviling
                    him with the most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head,
                    and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was his
                    slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses and stores, Mr G.
                    Johnstone was ordered to stand in a certain spot, under pain of
                    being shot ; but had he remained, sufforation[?] must have been
                    his fate, being so near the buildings in flames : he therefore risked being
                    shot, and came off, and thereby effected a timely escape.</p>
         <p>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exercised on a
                    poor horse, which they made us of all day in carting their
                    plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to the cart, tied him to
                    the end of the dwelling-house then in flames, and amused themselves in
                    looking at the poor animal making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he
                    was burnt, and his bones seen there by the writer of this."</p>

         <p>Canada Papers</p>
         <p>Montreal, Oct. 29 The express from Upper Canada, which arrived
                    yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory reports of the
                    preceding day, that the enemy had precipitately retreated on the 19th
                    instant, from before Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of
                        provisions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they
                    had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their force, and were
                    blowing up the works at Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>Further accounts from Kingston have been received this morning to
                    the 26th instant, when the official report of the enemy's retreat from Fort
                    Erie, after the destruction of the works, had not reached that place,
                    but there was no doubt of the fact.</p>
         <p>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps pressing on the enemy ; the
                    master of a mail which arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four
                    hours from Fort George, further confirms the previous intelligence,
                    and reports that several hundred prisoners were taken, before the Americans
                    effected their escape across the river.</p>
         <p>On the 18th the British came up with his rear guard, and in a sharp action
                    thirty of the Americans were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening
                    on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– The enemy then fled
                    with the utmost precipitation to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of
                    his fortifications.</p>
         <p>A military courier from Kingston arrived this morning, brings no additional
                    news of importance.– Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the
                    sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again sailed for the head of
                    the Lake.</p>
         <p>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, says that a severe action
                    took place the day before near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed
                    and wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be very considerable ; a
                    field piece made to bear upon one of his columns did great execution.
                    Another letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wounded 25 or 30.</p>
         <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. From Upper Canada we have received nothing of
                    importance. The report of the whole American armies have crossed the
                    Niagara was a mistake as the last accounts from that quarter mention that
                        General Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>Quebec, Nov. 3. We are in expectation of some further details of the
                    operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's Montreal post ; but they
                    had no arrived at one o'clock.</p>
         <p>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on that frontier is a striking
                    illustration of the importance of the command of the lake. The
                    enemy did cross over to our side till the moment his fleet was ready
                    to assume the superiority. The re-appearance of our fleet
                    effected what could not be done by the expence of so much blood and
                    treasure.</p>
         <p>(From the Quebec Gazette) The American Government has published the papers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We confess that we
                    have seen these papers with feelings of some satisfaction and much regret ;
                    satisfaction that we can now say that the honour of the British
                    Government is pledged to do something for British interests
                    in North American, and regret that that something is so little.</p>
         <p>The Indians are to be made independent of both nations. This is perfectly
                    just, and would, under certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of
                    these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively British. On these
                    subjects we must be permitted to ask how long they would be permitted to
                    remain so, how long the Indians would retain their independence in the event of another war, if the communication
                    with them should be in the power of the enemy ? The sole communication for
                    military purposes, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the
                    river St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from Niagara to Fort
                    Erie ; and the Americans are to be permitted to remain in possession of one
                    of its banks ! The enemy has hitherto been prevented from interrupting this communication by the thinness of the
                    settlements of their side, the consequent badness of the roads, and
                    difficulty of supplying a large force. The possession of th southern bank
                    of the St Lawrence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power
                    of supplying themselves, and operating on that frontier, by
                    the roads now existing, and from Lake Champlain, has been worth a large
                    force to them, during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to
                    parcel our force to support the line of communication between Lake St
                    Francis and Kingston, and keep a great proportion of it to protect the base
                    of that line in the vicinity of Montreal.</p>
         <p>The position of Canada, relative to the United States, with its present
                    boundaries, is an extraordinary one ; so much so, that
                    intelligent military men have pronounced it incapable of defence much
                    beyond Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's preparations, the superiority which we then had on the Lakes, the good
                    disposition of the inhabitants, and the prudent conduct of the commander of
                    the forces, alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting and
                    conveying supplies by a communication of five</p>
         <p>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the enemy's
                    frontie, is conceivable only to those whom experience has made
                    acquainted with the fact, or who are habituated to reflection ; and
                    whenever the communication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the
                    supply of any force further advanced on the line becomes
                    utterly impracticable. The enemy derives his supplies either by the Lakes,
                    upon which an army can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long
                    way in his rear, protected by his army, a country covered
                    with woods, and a militia more effective than the best troops in such a
                    country, always ready for the protection of their property and their
                    houses– Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army
                    beyond a certain point is to be counted by its numbers.</p>
         <p>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part of the State of New York
                    extending to the St Lawrence, between Lake Ontario and Lake
                    Champlain, shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada must fall
                    to the United States, the Lower Canada will not be defensible but at an
                    expence of means far beyond its value. We had much rather see the
                    Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's Harbour,
                    Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, than in the possession of the
                    tract of country just mentioned. Great Britain will always have the
                    means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, whenever she chuses
                    to exert them, but she never will be able to drive the Americans out of
                    that frontier, when once fully settled, supported as they will
                    be by the immense population of the back parts of the State of New
                    York and adjoining States.</p>
         <p>From the United States PapersUrbanna, Sept. 25. An express has arrived from Detroit, to General
                    M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass says–" A state of
                    things has arrived, in which your presence, with the force at your
                    disposal, is essential to the security and preservation of the country. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on every side
                    of us ; they are murdering the people, and breaking up the settlements.
                    There is now a large force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place,
                    most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed purpose of
                    attacking the town. We have no force adequate to the defence of the
                    country, and none of description proper for the pursuit of the
                    Indians– My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the
                    mounted men with all possible expedition."</p>
         <p>The express came by water, the land communiation being entirely
                    cut off.</p>
         <p>Albany, Oct. 25. The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday,
                    after a session of four weeks. The principal laws passed are:</p>
         <p>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of this State.
                    An act to encourage privateering. An act to authorise the raising of a
                    corps of sea fencibles. An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums
                    of money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New York, for the
                    defence of the State, and for other purposes. An act to prevent the
                    apprehension of British deserters. An act to authorise the raising of two
                    regiments of men of colour. An act authorising additional pay to be
                    made to the volunteers, and for paying the militia called into
                    service by the State authority. An act to aid in the apprehension of
                    deserters from the army and navy of the United States.</p>
         <p>The first act authorises the Governor to call into actual service 12,000
                    men, for the term of two years, provided the Government of the United
                    States shall have declared their intention to pay, clothe and subsist them at their expence.</p>
         <p>The privateer bill authorises associations to incorporate
                    themselves for the purpose of fitting out privateers.</p>
         <p>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Monell, passed both
                    Houses of our Legislature unanimously on Saturday:–</p>
         <p>Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of the State of New
                    York view, with mingled emotions of surprise and indignation,
                    the extravagant and disgraceful terms proposed by the British Commissioners
                    at Ghent–that, however ardently they may desire the
                    restoration of peace to their country, they can never consent to receive it
                    at the sacrifice of national honour and dignity–that they therefore
                    strongly recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the
                    vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of the war, as
                    the best means of the bringing the contest to an honourable
                    termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their posterity their
                    rights, liberty, and independence.</p>
         <p>The following is a private letter which was brought by the Liffey :</p>
         <p>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. "Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the
                    10th October, where his presence has been of the utmost
                    importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade of that place on the 8th, and
                    retired with his squadron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which
                    was ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's arrival,
                    sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of the 90th, and a supply of
                    provisions and stores for the right division, and arrived off Fort George
                    on the evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforcement, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th.</p>
         <p>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by General Izard's army, making a
                    force of 7 or 8000 men, advanced upon General Drummond, and attacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th instant
                    ; but having met with an opposition unexpected by them, and
                    making no impression, retired on the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from
                    whence they advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the 19th,
                    with a view of our turning our right, and attempted to cross the
                    Chippawa, about six miles from its mouth, where they were met with by a
                    corps of about 1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them most
                    manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in which the Glengarries
                    supported their high character, and, in the evening, Jonathan finding himself foiled, and unable to bring
                    up his artillery from the horrid state of the roads, retired again to the
                    main body at Black Creek.</p>
         <p>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– those of the enemy
                    were said to have been considerable, though he refrained from exposing
                    himself to our fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces there,
                    and whenever the enemy showed a column out of the wood, a well-directed
                    discharge soon obliged them to return to their shelter. By this
                    time our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, and they
                    commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort Erie.</p>
         <p>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by our advance, under Major-General
                    Watteville, close to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the high
                    ground, which General Drummond had not left many weeks before, and could
                    push no further. At the date of the last accounts from General Drummond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which it
                    will require a few columns of fresh troops to dislodge him, but
                    as they are now on their way to join the right dividion, I trust I shall in
                    a short time have the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expulsion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is said,
                    that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of General Izard's
                    force had crossed to Buffalo, and that they had passed over some heavy
                    artillery and stores, leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived
                        capable of defending it.</p>
         <p>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton of the 1st battalion of the
                    King's regiment, and the</p>
         <p>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He sailed again on the
                    1st inst. taking with him about 1200 men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of
                    artillery, a 9pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d
                        regiments, and a large supply of provisions and stores.
                    The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to York would be
                    crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, 850 strong, were to have been
                    embarked in the fleet, but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st,
                    89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by this trip of
                    the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to make another this season. The
                    St Lawrence has proved a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with
                    her. The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she has been laid
                    down and lengthened to make her the size of the Prince Regent. The keel of
                    a 74 is also laid down there. The Americans are said to have commenced upon two more ships of the class of the Superior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th October state, that the
                    capture of the two schooners will be attended with the most important
                    benefits in the security of that post, and the territory dependent
                    upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment of the 81st under
                    Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, arrived there on the 14th October,
                    without any casualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with
                    his brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two schooners had made a
                    trip to Nottawasage for provisions and supplies, and would
                    attempt another before the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been
                    sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain.</p>
         <p>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and supplying General Drummond's
                    army being completed, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour
                    being deemed impracticable this season, Sir George returned
                    last evening to this place ; his journey to Kingston has
                    certainly had the effect of inducing General Brown, with a
                    considerable part of his force, to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus
                    left General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that I have little
                    doubt of the result of an attack upon him.</p>
         <p>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party here has been at work
                    at your side of the water ; it has increased tenfold since the expression
                    of the public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the addresses
                    which are now preparing, and which I can assure you is the real and
                    unsolicited voice of the people. I am happy to find that General Kempt
                    is going to England, as he will afford true information upon the state of
                    the country, and be able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circulated respecting recent events."</p>

      <text>
         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the Blue Mountains,
                    performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie, Governor of the
                    settlement. From the official account, dated Sydney, June 10.
                    1815.</p>
         <p>The Governor desires to communicate, for the information of the public, the
                    result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying
                    westward of them, which had been explored in the latter end of the year
                    1813, and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William Evans, Deputy
                    Surveyor of Lands.</p>
         <p>To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto
                    occupied by the colonists of New South Walves, extending along the
                    eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles, and
                    westward about 40 miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in the
                    interior which forms its western boundary, it must be a subject of
                    astonishment and regret, that amongst so large a population no one appeared, within the first twenty-five years of the
                    establishment of this settlement, possessed of sufficient
                    energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over
                    these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of
                    that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded
                    sufficient produce for the wants of the people, whilst on the other hand,
                    the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a
                    thick, and in many places, nearly an impenetrable forest,
                    the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate
                    very considerably.</p>
         <p>The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold
                    attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the
                    Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the other by Mr Caley,
                    and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not
                    be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these
                    mountains.</p>
         <p>To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of
                    the Royal veteran company, the merit is due of having, with
                    extraordinary patience and much fatigu, effected the first
                    passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains.</p>
         <p>The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object,
                    had, early after his arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of
                    encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country, and
                    willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these
                    three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the 20th of November
                    1813, he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr
                    George William Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result
                    of whose journey was laid before the public, through the medium of the
                    Sydney Gazette, on the 12th of February, 1814.</p>
         <p>The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored,
                    induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage
                    and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and
                    men of good character, from amongst a number of convicts who
                    had volunteered their services, were selected to perform this arduous
                    work, on condition of being fed and clothed during the
                    continuance of their labour, and being granted emancipations as their
                    final reward on the completion of the work.</p>
         <p>The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to
                    William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered,
                    and sees what has been done, he effected its completion in six months from
                    the time of its commencement, happily without the loss of a man, or
                    any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the
                    services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in the execution of this
                    arduous work, which promises to be of the greatest public
                    utility, by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily
                    relinquished the comforts of his own house, and the society of
                    his numerous family, and exposed himself to much personal fatigue,
                    with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford
                    from the inclemency of the season, it is difficult to express
                    the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and
                    services are entitled.</p>
         <p>Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of
                    January, the Governor, accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that
                        gentleman, commenced his tour on the 25th of April
                    last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined by Sir John Jamieson, at
                    the Nepean, who accompanied him during the entire tour. The
                        following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr
                    Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Major of Brigade ;
                    Lieutenant Watts, Aide de camp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ;
                    Mr Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr
                    Lewin, Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor
                    of lands, who had been sent forward for the purpose of
                    making further discoveries, and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at
                    Bathurst Plains.</p>
         <p>The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot, and
                    thence to a resting place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve
                    miles from Emu Ford, was through a very handsome open
                    forests of lofty trees, and much more practicable and easy than was
                    expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited
                    surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a
                    just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further
                        disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and the latter barren and
                    rocky. At this place, the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence.
                    Here the country became altogether mountainous, and
                    extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the
                    measure commences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted
                    attention. It is close to the line of road, on the top of a rugged and
                    abrupt ascent, and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr
                    Caley, as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor
                    gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have
                    penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of
                    steep and rugged hills, some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a
                    passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the summit of the western
                    mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect
                    presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor, the
                    river Hawkesbury, Prospect Hill, and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited,
                    of equal interest, are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic
                        grandeur of the situation, combined with the various
                    objects to be seen from this place, induced the Governor to give it
                    the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the
                    King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of
                    immense depth, at the bottom of which is seen a glen, as
                    romantically beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the further side
                    by mountains of great magnitude, terminating equally abruptly as the
                    others, and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this
                    picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles, to which the
                        Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen.
                    Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile, on the top of a hill, an opening
                    presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen,
                    from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and
                    grand–mountains rising beyond mountains, with stupendous
                    masses of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye with admiration
                    and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully
                        disposed induced the Governor to give the name of
                    Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this
                    offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from
                    hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which
                    forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly
                    terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high, as
                    ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged
                    and tremendous descent, through all its windings, is no less than
                    three-fourths of a mile in length, and has been executed with such skill
                    and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone, and the difficulties surmounted, can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order
                    to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor
                        deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name
                    to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he accordingly
                    called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the
                    bottom of this pass, the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain
                    is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only
                    practicable point yet discovered for descending by, yet the mountain is
                    much higher than those on either side of it, from whence it is
                    distinguished at a considerable distance, when approaching it
                    from the interior, and in this point of view it has the appearance of
                    a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact only the abrupt
                    termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this
                    termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of
                    York.</p>
         <p>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was much gratified by the appearance
                    of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was
                    the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The
                    valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of
                    that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality, and
                    very [?]dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it
                    from the eastward, which unites itself at the western extremity of the
                    vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The
                    junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river, now called
                    by the Governor, Cox's River, which takes its course, as has been since
                    ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties itself into
                    the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured, from the nature of the
                    country through which it passes, that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury, into
                    which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of
                    Mount York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, and has its
                    termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country
                    again becomes hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and very
                    good passage.</p>
         <p>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland,
                    Wentworth, and Lawson, had formerly terminated their excursion ;
                    and when the various difficulties are considered which they
                    had to contend with, especially until they had effected the descent from
                    Mount York, to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick
                    brush-wood, where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for
                    their baggage horses, the severity of which labour had seriously
                    affected their healths, their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot
                    fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their
                    merits, three beautiful high hills, joining each other at the
                    end of their tour at this place, have receieved their names in the
                    following order, viz. Mount Blaxland, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf,
                    and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow
                    vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River, for a
                    distance of 16 miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the
                    stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive
                    on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence
                    Hilly Range.</p>
         <p>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short distance from it, a very
                    singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions, its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking
                    rock, nearly circular in form, which gives the whole very much the
                    appearance of a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To this
                    lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first European discoverer, gave
                    the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is distant from the pass of the
                    Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level, and the first met with
                    unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent, but
                    abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants, such as would
                    probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The
                    beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east, between
                    hills of easy ascent, thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth
                    Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in other respects
                    resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some
                    miles. Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles from Sidmouth
                    Valley, the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of
                    the country, which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from
                    the height of the banks, and its general width, the Campbell River must
                    be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but
                    the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western
                    side of the mountains, equally as throughout this colony for the last three years, has reduced this river so much, that it may
                    be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the
                        present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River, the very curious animal called the Paradox, or
                    Water Mole, is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is
                    uncommonly rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to
                    the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River, there
                    is a very fine rich track of low lands, which has been named Mitchell
                    Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish
                    River, which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to
                    the northward of the road and bridge over the latter, has also two very
                    fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Connel
                    Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both of considerable extent, and
                    very capable of yielding all the necessities of life.</p>
         <p>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River,
                    Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on both sides
                    by gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie
                    River, which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell
                    River, takes a winding course through the Plains, which can be easily
                    traced from the high lands ajoining, by the particular verdure of the
                    trees on its banks, which are likewise the only trees throughout
                    the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains
                    gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of
                    cultivation.</p>
         <p>It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration
                    and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space
                    of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the
                    occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind
                    which may be more easily imagined than described.</p>
         <p>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May,
                    and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie
                    River–the situation being selected in consequence of
                    its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles
                    in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for
                    a week, which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions
                    through the adjoining country, on both sides the river.</p>
         <p>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the
                    erection of a town at some future period, to which he gave the name of
                    Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The
                    situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach
                    of any floods which may occur, and is at the same time so near to the
                    river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and
                    beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description
                    who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to
                        themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a beautiful
                    river flowing through it, for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however
                    add, that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in
                    disappointment.</p>
         <p>During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily
                    excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a
                    south-west direction, and on that occasion, as well as on all the
                    others, he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains,
                    separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout
                    being generally fertile, and well circumstanced for the purpose
                    of agriculture or grazing.</p>
         <p>The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to
                    communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received
                    of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any
                    means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers
                    there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of
                    the colony but rarely, and of course will have them seldom to
                    encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficiency of grass are to be
                    found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over
                    them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage
                    which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase
                    of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years.</p>
         <p>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less
                    than 50,000 acres of land clear of timber, and fully one half of that
                    may be considered excellent soil, well calculated for cultivation. It
                    is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber
                        degenerates ; and it is to be remarked, that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior
                    both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is,
                    however, a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the
                    district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and
                    husbandry.</p>
         <p>The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been
                    yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so
                    much importance, that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that
                    country shall be settled.</p>
         <p>Having enumerated the principal and most important features of
                    this new country, the Governor has now to notice some of its
                    live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety
                    of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of
                    fish, but all of one denomination, resembling the perch in
                    appearance, and of a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a
                    rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and is very voracious.
                    Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at
                    the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb
                    ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught
                    some weighing 25 lb.</p>
         <p>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black swans, wild geese, wild
                    turkies, bustards, ducks of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pigeons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or paradox, also
                    abounds in all the rivers and ponds.</p>
         <p>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by observation taken at the
                    Flag Staff, which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that
                    name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, being also 27 1/2
                    miles north of Government House, In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing
                    west 20. 30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the
                    measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles.</p>
         <p>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on the left bank of the river
                    Nepean, and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst.
                    This road has been carefully measured, and each mile regularly marked
                    on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst.</p>
         <p>The Governor in his tour made the following stages, in which he was
                    principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for
                    the cattle, and plenty of water :–</p>
         <p>1st stage–Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage
                    ditto–Jamieson's Valley, or 2d depot, distant from ditto . . . . . .
                    . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath, distant from ditto . . . 41 4th
                    ditto–Cox's River, distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The
                    Fish River, distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley,
                    distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River, distant from ditto
                    . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2</p>
         <p>At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good
                    grass, and water in abundance.</p>
         <p>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Governor and suite set out from
                    Bathurst on their return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th
                    Ult.</p>
         <p>The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public,
                    that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the
                    Blue Mountains, until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's
                    Ministers on that subject, and in reply to the report he is now about to
                    make them upon it.</p>
         <p>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may
                    wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so, on making a written application to the Governor to that effect,
                    who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same
                    time strictly ordered and directed that no person, whether civil
                    or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without
                    having previously applied for and obtained permission, in the above
                    prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on
                    the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the
                    progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The
                        necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing
                    this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to
                    require any explanation here.</p>
         <p>The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour, without offering his
                    best ackowledgements to William Cox, Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a
                    period of time, by opening a passage to the new discovered country, and at
                    the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in
                    recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the
                    favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.</p>

      <header>Canada Papers Montreal, Oct  5 ...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Canada Papers.</p>
         <p>Montreal, Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie seized
                    on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, amounting to upward of 12,000
                    dollars, arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.</p>
         <p>At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord
                    Selkirk ; they are very important, as many ex parte
                    details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm, making
                    all the partners of the North West Company prisoners, &amp;c. ;
                    but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian
                    Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert
                    Semple, the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River,
                    towards the close of the year 1815, took possession of two
                    establishments belonging to the North West Company, which had obtruded
                    themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North
                    West traders then altered their route, going into the Upper Country by
                        circuitous ways, by which much delay took place ; and
                    in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cartloads of
                    provisions by the former track in June last, with a guard of fifty men ;
                    the advance, twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of the
                    natives, whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The
                    rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were
                    perceived by the Governor, and were attacked by a party from the
                    garrison, consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place,
                        stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men
                    were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is
                    on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was
                    undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the
                    expedition we do not justify, nor indeed can we form any opinion
                    on the subject without further authentic details ; it is, however, but
                    justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights, and
                    are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders, though we believe a
                    most respectable body, are only an Association of Merchants.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Canada Lord Selkirk</p>
         <p>We have been favoured by a Gentleman in this city, with the following
                    interesting and authentic communication, on the subject of the
                    dispute between Lord Selkirk, and the Gentlemen of the North West
                    Company:</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter from Montreal, dated 6th October,1816.</p>
         <p>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some accounts of the
                    disturbances which have taken place in the North West between the North
                    West Company and Lord Selkirk's colonists. The latter have been
                    obliged to leave the Red River, after having had 22 of their men, including
                    Governor Semple, killed by a party of half-breeds,
                    the spurious offspring of the North West Company. As yet have not had an
                    accurate statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party
                    state that these half-breed with some of the North West Company servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr Semple,
                    with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, to know what could
                    be their intentions, when those rascals commenced firing on
                    them, and massacred all but three, who were fortunate enough to
                    make their escape. The North West people's account is that these half-breeds with some Indians were
                        bringing down provisions from the upper part of the Red
                    River to the entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the
                        command of a great part of the river, they were obliged to
                    pass in the rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Semple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his
                    Fort with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the provisions which were intended for the North West Company ; that
                    the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of the
                    Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk [?] from Montreal
                    for the Red River about the latter end of June, when[?] three or four
                    officers and about 150 men of De Men[?]'s regiment, which had
                    been disbanded, and when he arrived at Fort William on Lake Superior,
                    hearing the fate of his Colonists, he[?] immediately issued a
                    warrant against Mr M'Gillivray for high treason, conspiracy and murder, and
                    subsequently warrants against all the partners of the N. W.
                    Company, who were at F William, [?] formal possession of their
                    establishment there, and sent Mr M'Gillivray, with about ten others,
                    prisoners to Montreal, with all their papers [?] a number of packs of
                    Beaver and other Furs, and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found
                    in possession of the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay
                        Company. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days
                        examining the papers, and about four or five days after the
                    arrival of Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to
                        appear to take their trial at the next criminal court, or
                    any court of Oyer and Terminer which may be appointed. Stuart (the ci-de vant Solicitor-General, who was dismissed by Sir James Craig,
                    and at whose instance an ineffectual attempt was lately made by some
                    misguided members of our House of Assembly to impeach Chief Justices Sewell
                    and Monk) is one of Lord Selkirk's counsel and spoke at great
                    length, and what his friends and admirers call very eloquently,
                    strongly opposed their being admitted to bail, but all would not do, and
                    they were accordingly bailed ; Mr M'Gillivray in sureties of t1000 and the
                    others in t500, sums inconsiderable enough, advering to the high crimes and
                    misdemeanours with which they were charged.</p>
         <p>"In the Montreal Herald you will see a very learned, and
                    (as our neighbour Jonathan would say) a lengthy
                    communication, signed Montius[?], setting forth the
                    rights which the Hudson's Bay Company by their charter possess over the
                    Countries which they have granted to Lord Selkirk, and the power vested in
                    him of appointing Governors and other Officers to superintend and
                    regulate the Colony. Being a masterly production, it will no doubt
                    makes its appearance in a pamphlet, and when it does, I shall send you one,
                    in case the papers should miscarry. It is uncertain whether the
                    Earl will remain in the North West during the winter, or come down to
                    Montreal ; if the latter, he must be down[?] soon[?], as the season for
                    water-travelling will shortly close.</p>
         <p>"Montreal is now divided into two parties, one favouring the Lord, and the
                    other the North West Company ; and with the exception of the
                    friends of the latter, strongly in favour of his Lordship."</p>

                    with about 40 steerage passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who
                    were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that
                    can be named our passage disagreeable, and upon one occasion
                    very perilous, from lightning, which struck the ship twice, shivered
                    two of the masts, killed a man, struck several people slightly, between two
                    of whom I was sitting, without at all feeling the blow.</p>
         <p>Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and, it is
                    stated in some of the public papers here, that many hundreds have,
                    during the last year, accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go
                    and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to
                    emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no
                    place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does
                    not work himself ; no place in short, for any one who is not able and
                    willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there
                    is every where a plentiful, happy, and easy life. None should come,
                    however, who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious
                    poor, I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling, and
                        undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage,
                    in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of
                    their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot
                    come under the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single man 20
                    guineas, before he gets into work again ; and, as I always said, I never
                    would, if I were in the place of such a man, expend my earnings on a
                    sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, in order to remove one eye sore
                    out of the way of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, which is
                    not so good as ours, though it is not bad, and people often live to an old
                    age. The country is good, but it will easily be conceived, that new
                    face, an entire new scene, a separation from every friend, work
                    done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will
                    easily be conceived, that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's
                    mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect
                    to find work the first day. He must ask first, at any rate. Englishmen
                    are sheepish ; and, they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster
                    their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption
                    at home. In short, I advice nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe
                    the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling
                    and farming in the new countries, it is neither more nor less than
                    downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for
                    ; and the far greater part of all such speculations end in disappointment, if not in ruin and premature death. I
                    hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with
                    money in their pockets, my advice is, not to give way either to
                    enthusiastic admiration, or to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to
                    look about them ; to see not only after good land, but a good market
                    for its products. The western romance writers tell us, that the land in the
                    Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valuable book,
                    tells us, that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent
                        country for people who want to do nothing but eat. –
                    Give me Long Island, where the land is not too good ; but where beef
                    and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money);
                    where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a
                    ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an
                    English farmer (I mean by English, people of the whole of
                    the United Kingdom) comes here, with money in his pocket, let him
                    resolve to keep it there for a year, and then he will be sure to do well.
                    – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract
                    the attention and to please the sight of one, like myself, brought up in
                    the country, always greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in,
                    various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged
                    busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees, of which
                    there are multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or round the
                    fields, have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit.
                    The apple and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty acres on
                    each farm, are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ;
                    no appearance of want amongst the labourers, who receive, in the country, about two shillings and threepence
                    (our money) a-day, with board and lodging, and which board consists of
                    plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of bread,
                    butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of
                    living, I will state a few facts, which have already come within my
                    own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, thirteen miles from New
                    York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day
                    passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going
                    thither, and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind, I
                    shall always speak in English money, when I do not speak of
                    dollars. We lodge and board in this inn, have each a bed-room and good
                    bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it
                    really is eating. – We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs,
                    for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever sa), crackers, sweet
                    cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things, I do not
                    mean that we get them for show, or just enough to smell to ; but in
                    loads. Not an egg, but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ;
                    but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not
                    broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut, but in good thumping
                    pieces. For dinner, we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lobsters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper
                    is like the breakfast, with preserved peaches and other things. And with
                    all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the kindest and most
                    obliging treatment, on the part of the landlord and landlady, and their
                    sons and daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In
                    England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly
                    the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can
                    purchase any where. The first is, no grumbling on the part of the landlady,
                    except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the
                    other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run
                    in over the latch of the door, to a house which is full of valuable things
                    of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things much more
                    carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here,
                    then are we able to live at an inn, one of the most respectable in the
                    whole country, at the rate of fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a
                    common farming man is not much short of that sum.</p>

         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>The authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some
                    German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we are told,
                    guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief
                    :</p>
         <p>"Libson, Nov. 4</p>
         <p>"We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy
                    reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the
                    commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We
                    have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons
                    to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the
                    shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the
                    victims of this error, than to the abominable speculations of
                    cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations.</p>
         <p>"the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland, occasioned by a
                    superabundance of population, and by the bad harvests of late years,
                    serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, who seek to
                    establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the
                    former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention
                    of Governments, and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make
                    known the fate of an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amsterdam last August.</p>
         <p>"But we shall first transcribe, from the original, the article of
                    the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the
                        persons of the passengers, as inlcuding stipulations
                    which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic
                    :–</p>
         <p>"We passengers, promise to fulfil faithfully the following
                    conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above
                    stipulated, for so much as we have not yet paid, we engage to
                    gain by our labour in America, what we owe, and we who owe the whole amount
                    of our passage are bound, if required, and if we are unable to
                    find better conditions, to hire ourselves for four or five years, in order
                    to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of
                    our passage, equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time
                    for the sum we still owe.</p>
         <p>"We promise besides, we passengers, men or women, fathers or
                    mothers, children and families here assembled, the children for their
                    parents, the parents for their children, the brother for his brother, and
                    the sister for her sister, when we shall find an opportunity to employ
                    ourselves in America, to engage ourselves in service, and to answer for one
                    for the other one for all the others, whether he be of our family or not,
                    so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as
                    shall be necessary, until we all and our families have employment, and the
                    captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have
                    children, a family, brothers, and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives
                    or husbands, our children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately
                    to whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession,
                    or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the price of
                    our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the
                    engagements proposed to us, or contract others without the permission not
                    knowledge of the capain, it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for
                    their passage, for those who still owe part, and for those who cannot find
                    an engagement, that they must consent to me, the captain,
                    carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me, and
                    wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it may suit
                    me to sail."</p>
         <p>"These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had
                    contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed
                    first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from
                    Amsterdam, and in defiance of the clauses of the contract, by
                    which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage,
                    he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after
                    62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon the ship, that she
                    was in danger of sinking, and famine had already made frightful ravages. It
                    was at the end of that time, and in this deplo rable condition, that
                    she was forced into Belem, near Lisbon.</p>
         <p>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the passengers had been reduced to
                    the greatest misery, not more by the small quantity than by the
                    bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone, and sea-water was
                    their only drink. So much had they been wasted, that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great
                    many sick, some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal.</p>
         <p>"The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council
                    of Health, who, apprehensive of contagion, were for an instant
                        fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to
                    sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable, because the
                    ship was not in a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly have
                    perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary, and a quarantine
                    was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions
                    and other succours should be furnished at the expence of
                    the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording
                    assistance.</p>
         <p>"Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have, no doubt, answered
                    as little the expectations of those who, seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which
                    they could not find, abandoning their country, their parents, and
                    their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with 106 Swiss passengers,
                    was at Lisbon, in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said
                    here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to
                    seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if
                    they reach their destination, they are soon convinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.</p>
         <p>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in countries where these
                    emigrations are excited, to insert the article relative to the charter
                        party, given above, in order that the simple and
                    credulous may see what they have to undergo."</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope, dated
                    15th Nov. 1817: –</p>
         <p>"The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour
                    on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off
                    Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, was boarded at
                    about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters
                    from his Majesty's 10th regiment, and convicts, about 12 in
                    number, i. e.five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after securing the
                    hatches, &amp;c. obtained possession of the ship, and in the same instant
                    cut the cables, loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. wind,
                    succeeded in carrying her off, at six a.m.The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to
                    join them in their piratical undertaking, with the exception of
                    the mate, were permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which reached

         <p>"By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden
                    with Government stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the
                    morning of the 20th of June last, having struck on the reef Roan de
                    Nova, in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved."</p>
         <p>A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th Nonember, says – "
                    Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor- General of Lower Canada, with Captain Campbell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, jun. arrived
                    here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you
                    is, that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the
                    St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line about 100 miles ; in
                    this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and
                    sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same
                    line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great
                    ability, and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses
                        confidence on each side, rendering their arduous task
                    less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden
                    wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money scarce.
                    Government bills are 3 per cent advance, but expected to be
                    lower, in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take
                    the provincial notes."</p>
         <p>Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard–On Friday
                    night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place was thrown into the
                    greatest consternation, by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard,
                    the beating of drums, and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was
                    occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to
                    the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the
                    southern part of the dock- yard, near the kilns used for burning cement
                    stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety
                    of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the
                    spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, which, from the
                    pressure of the times and want of employment, is crowded with many
                        unfortunate individuals. Providence, however, averted
                    the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of
                    seeing the raging flames subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house.
                    No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but one poor man is
                    severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland, and the officers of
                    that ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and Captain Brown and
                    the officers of the Ordinary, with the military officers and soldiers of
                    the garrison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter were
                    under arms the whole time, and were of great service in keeping off the
                    spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious
                    apprehensions, as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern, and the
                    residence of Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the landlady of
                    the house had but recently lain in, and was removed on the first alarm
                    being given. Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, was here yesterday to
                    investiage into the cause, which it is suspected arose from carlessness
                    – The damage, however, has not been so great as was at first
                    expected, and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual
                    assistance that was given – Sheerness,

         <p>Irish Emigrants. New York, Nov. 27.</p>
         <p>Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an
                        unfriended stranger arrived here, from across the Atlantic, without the means of helping himself, and without
                    even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him
                    to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of
                    absolute want. Such, however, is actually the situation of
                    hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn
                    beings, several attempts have been made by associations of humane
                    individuals here, but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as
                    that of which an account here follows: –</p>
         <p>At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, held at Harmony Hall,
                    on Tuesday the 25th instant, for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of
                    Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris,
                    Chairman, WM. Sampson, Secretary ;</p>
         <p>Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, the circular previously issues on
                    this subject was read by the Secretary : –</p>
         <p>CircularIt is a sentiment long felt, and often expressed, that
                    something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who
                    flock to these shores.</p>
         <p>Without any fixed destination, they remain in the sea port, until beocming
                    victims of bad counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and honest
                    energies with which they left their native land, and suffer worse than
                    shipwreck in their moral qualities.</p>
         <p>The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be
                    derived from so great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully
                    directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength,
                    men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so
                    many ties. But it is in the order of things, that some of the friends,
                    particularly the countrymen of these emigrants, who have been some time
                        established and known, should come forward to attest the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of the
                    enterprise.</p>
         <p>If his has not been done sooner, it is because every advance in social
                    improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion,
                    and the voice of the times that now speak.</p>
         <p>It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement,
                    there are some tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, where
                    the Irish emigrant, with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed,
                    and in a climate congenial to his habits, might procure to
                    himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, in a few years,
                    be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him.</p>
         <p>We, whose names are undersigned, have met to consult upon the means of
                    promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the
                    distressed, and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We
                    have thought of no better way than to address, by this circular,
                    the friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-operation
                    might give most weight to the measure, and to submit, whether it might not
                    be advisable to join all our efforts, and petition Congress early in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suitable track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, subject to such
                    conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting.</p>
         <p>to the Government we would offer no deceptive, delusive, or
                    precarious motive, rather chusing to make its wisdom, benignity,
                    and patriotism, the anchor of our hope.</p>
         <p>We request of our, if you approve of our sentiment and of our
                    project, to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ;
                    either by forming organized associations, or by obtaining
                        individual signatures, to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, and have
                    rather chosen to make this humble beginning, in hopes that we
                    should soon receive additional light upon the subject from correspondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, proceed to investigate
                    the subject, and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men,
                    and request of you to do the same.</p>
         <p>You will please address your answers, and any future correspondence, to Mr
                    James Moffit, No. 15. Frankfort Street New York.</p>
         <p>Thomas Addit Emmet. Denis M'Carthy, William Sampson, John R.
                    Skiddy, James R. Mullaney, John Meyher, William James M'Neven,
                    Cornelius Heeny, Matthew Carroll, Robert Swanton, James
                    Moffit. New York, Nov 18, 1817</p>
         <p>Mr Emmet then stated, that he had been requested by the gentlemen
                    who called this meeting, to explain the objects for which it was
                        convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin, on the situation
                    of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one
                    of unqualified misetry, partly occasioned by their local
                    oppressions, and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it
                    compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers, and under the
                    pressure of so great poverty, that the most active individual
                        benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient
                    present succour, nor procure for them, within a reasonable time, the
                    means of permanent settlement. The consequence was, that many of
                    those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county, or
                    forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities,
                    whose original dispositions and qualifications, if rightly directed and employed, would have made them valuable
                    and useful members of the community. Besides, the accounts
                    transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute
                    situations, deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of
                    wretchedness, from endeavouring to better their condition in this more
                    fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of
                    which they were also more strongly attached.</p>
         <p>A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to
                    come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government
                    might be induced, by a strong and united application, to grant a
                    portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful, so that an
                    asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, who
                    would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the
                    sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them
                    a rich harvest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where
                    they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication
                    liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed
                        auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown, and
                    probably few would now be led by political prejudices to
                    give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour
                    nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers
                    from Switzerland.</p>
         <p>It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or
                    the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer
                    nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers, who
                    in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically
                    attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived
                    all their blessings, and, wherever they were found, would form a barrier
                    against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the
                    generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States, and from the
                    acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible
                    arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only
                    those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here, whose
                    usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction, and who become
                    burdens or scourges to our cities, would be rescued and
                    placed in a situation where all the energies of active and
                    enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ;
                    but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible,
                    would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland, and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place
                    upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it
                    has been lately purchased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the
                    ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be brought into market
                    (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our
                        application, and grant to the settlers an extended
                    credit, Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon
                    as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale
                    came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich
                    during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive, and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and
                    immensely increased, to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the
                    strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be
                    strongly urged by men, who can most truly say they are actuated by no views
                    of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into
                    all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment,
                        without any prospect of gain, or even compensation,
                    except as to what may be necessary for defraying the
                    expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers
                    should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to
                    grant.</p>
         <p>These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized, if
                    supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us
                    in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, desirous of adopting
                    and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system
                    to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of societies totally
                    divested of all party or political feelings, and directing the attention
                    only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of
                    political institutions in every State, in which the zealous partizan (be
                    his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent.
                    Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather consecrated places, in
                    which, when we meet, we lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers
                    in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They
                    are consecrated to every man amongst us, by the purity of their
                    object, by our earliest recollections, by our unbroken
                    affection, and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love
                    of our native land, for which most of us have already renounced all
                    sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a
                    solemn pledge to the country of our adoption, that our hearts
                    will be always alive, from temperament as well as principle, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who
                    have pledged their faith to her, however they may seem to differ on some
                    minor political subjects, will always be found firmly ranged and
                    united under the same banners, and forming one phalanx whenever
                    her more important interests are concerned.</p>
         <p>Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which being severally put, were
                    carried with some slight amendments as follow :–</p>
         <p>1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and
                    descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of endeavouring to
                    procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory, to be
                    settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of
                    the foregoing description, who shall, on or before the second
                    day of December next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five
                    dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one
                    hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to
                    elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be
                    admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in
                    Irishmen, and the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of
                    the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this
                    city. 4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a
                        Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of
                    a memorial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of
                    the Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such
                    measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society.</p>
         <p>Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Emmet's motion, expressed,
                    in handsome terms, how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend,
                    had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of
                    an Irishman.</p>
         <p>A Committee was then appointed, pursuant to the fourth resolution, the
                    number being, upon motion and discussion, augmented to twentyone.</p>
         <p>Committee–Andrew Morris, Thomas Addis
                    Emmet, William Sampson, John W. Mulligan, Thomas Kirk, James Moffit,
                    Robert Swanton, Matthew Carroll, William James M'Neven, Captain Skiddy, Dennic M'Carthy, John Meyher, James M'Bride, Cornelius
                    Heeney, William Paterson, Colonel Mulaney, David Bryson, Captain
                    O'Sullivan, James J. M'Donnell, Dennis H. Doyle, James Hayes.</p>
         <p>A subscription paper being then opened, a number of those present subscribed
                    their names and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and became
                    members of the association. Those persons who wish to become
                    original members may do so by signing their names and paying their
                    subscription to the Secretary before 2d December, pursuant
                    to the second resolution.</p>
         <p>After the meeting was adjourned, the Committee organized itself,
                    and appointed Sub-Committees, to report a draft of a
                    constitution and a memorial to Congress, and for the discharge of
                    other requisite duties.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia,
                        totheir Correspondents in this quarter.</p>
         <p>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain
                    and Ireland, from the British North American Provinces, equal to the
                    additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further
                    suspended.</p>
         <p>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement
                    of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?]
                    at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India
                    Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], and that on very moderate terms
                    ; but, in the event of Government persisting in imposing the
                    Duty on Timber from hence, that branch of our trade will inevitably revert
                    to the Americans, besides being the ruin of many in this and in the
                    neighbouring Provinces.</p>
         <p>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country, upon trial,
                    will be found delusive ; to prove this, many obvious[?] reasons can be
                    adduced : As the trade now exists, all the Timber extracted from these
                    Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British
                    Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber, and the import
                    of so ponderous an article as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British
                    ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than
                    any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on
                    the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied
                    that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber,
                    they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers, but would not accept an
                    ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their
                    TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand, that
                    28s. was given for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in
                    favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these
                        Provinces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many
                    valuable settlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that
                    would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far
                    distant when they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.</p>
         <p>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern
                    countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived, the
                    merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters were not only
                    alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?], what
                    shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? They properly concluded that
                    perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment,
                    they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their
                    expectations. If therefore, in time of war, Britain has took to
                    her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ;
                    it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be
                    wholly neglected, when blessed with peace."</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter, dated Savannah, 25th Nov. 1817</p>
         <p>"In the Southern States, this autumn has been the most fatal they
                    have experienced since their colonization. Many thousands have
                    been hurried off to that " narrow house" destined for all that live. A most
                    malignant fever has prevailed to an alarming extent. In this city, during
                    the last four months, the deaths have been equal to one-eights of the
                    inhabitants left in it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the
                    Southern Counties, the morality has exceeded one-sixth!"</p>

      <header>CanadaPapers from Upper Canada...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft of a petition to the Prince
                    Regent, founded on the resolutions adopted in the province of Niagara, where some discontent has been manifested. The first
                    part is as follows:–</p>
         <p>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent of the United Kingdom
                    of Great Britain and Ireland, &amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants
                    of Upper Canada</p>
         <p>May it please your Royal Highness,</p>
         <p>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper Canada, should need no
                    words to give assurance of their loyalty, if the whole truth had reached
                    the throne of their Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the
                    truth has not been told.</p>
         <p>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed to the ravages of a
                    powerful and inveterate foe. The Government of the United States
                    had been long concerting the invasion of this province. Hostile
                    preparations against it had been long masked under other designs ; and at
                    last the accumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless
                        children of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by
                    the weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded those
                    host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of humanity,
                    and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from their true allegiance.
                    The subjects of Britain remained dauntless and firm. It was not for their
                    property that they rose against their invaders ; the invader would have
                    spared to them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the
                    rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American standard
                    been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a handful of British
                    troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of victory over the
                    protrate intruders on their soil. The second year of war saw
                    Canada contending with yet little assistance from the parent
                    state. The second year of the war saw her sons confirmed in their virtue,
                    and still more determined to resist. Wives and children had fled
                    from their homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of
                    revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; still was
                    the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it burn with patriotism
                    and loyalty.</p>
         <p>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for now the British
                    aid poured into the provinces, and peace was proclaimed when war was no
                    longer to be feared.</p>
         <p>"It is now more than three years since there was an end of war, but, strange
                    to say, these years of peace have manifested no appearance of
                    affection or care from the mother country to the Canadas. Commercial
                    treaties have been made, altogether neglectful of British interests here.
                        Government transactions, which used to give spirit to trade
                    and are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications are suffered
                    to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too shocking to be repeated in the
                    Royal ear. May it please your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the
                    complains and grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully
                    assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of most
                    important truths ; who are well assured of the generous
                    disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that British subjects
                    should every where share equally you paternal regard an
                    affection.</p>
         <p>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of the province to see,
                    even during the war, which afforded such striking proofs of their loyalty
                    and valour, reports went home highly rating the merits of regular troops,
                    while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set down, may,
                    the principles of the most loyal subjects here were often stigmatised by
                    British officers, ignorant of human character, and still more so of
                    circumstances which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so
                    with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Canadian
                    worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in the minds of the
                    Canadian people, a due regard for the genuine spirit of a British solider,
                    at once generous and brave.</p>
         <p>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain to notice the
                    misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary to notorious truth, if these
                    had not obviously conspired with other causes to lessen the regard which
                    should subsist between British subjects here and at home, to
                    influence the conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the
                        province.</p>
         <p>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada suffered grievously
                    during the war in their property, and many were bereft of their all. A
                    solemn investigation on this subject took place ; the claims of the
                    sufferers were authenticated, and there was every reason to
                    expect that recompence would immediately follow ; yet nothing
                    has followed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among
                    mankind a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals
                    of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public
                    calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives for
                    Government should not be disgusted with finding Government
                    regardless of those very principles which it is intended to
                    sustain. The people of this province are well aware that their fellow
                    subjects at home are pressed hard with taxations, and far it is from their
                    wish that relief should be afford from thence. Canada contains within itself ample means of exonerating Government from the claims
                    of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your Royal Highness
                    to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now justly complained of. Millions
                    of acres of fertile lands lie here at the disposal of your Royal Highness,
                    upon the credit of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims
                    of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums could be
                    raised for the improvement of the provinces, and the increase of revenue to
                    Britain.</p>
         <p>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Government to the
                    concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, and must be still more
                    abhorrent to the general feelings of your Royal Highness.</p>
         <p>"The young men of this province, who were armed in its defence had, for
                    their spirited conduct, the promise of their commanders, that land would be
                    granted them as a reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated
                    ; and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parliament of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face
                    of established British principles, that militia should pass beyond the
                    frontier. With these promises, and in obedience to this law, the militia
                    passed beyond the frontier with alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater
                    part of them had been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services,
                    and the land is unjudtly withheld."</p>
         <p>The petition further states that such ingratitude, such dishonour, such
                    errors in policy, could not exist without extraordinary influences, and it
                    recommends most important changes equally for the glory of the throne,
                    and benefit of the subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came
                    some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous ingratitude,
                    the the home Ministers wisely imposed restriction on the Land
                    Council of Upper Canada. It seems, however, that all this was
                    insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has grown out of this
                    unhappy system. Upper Canada, it is now said, pines in
                    comparative decay, and that discontent and poverty are experienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of
                    nature.</p>
         <p>It is insisted that the immediate interference of his Royal
                    Highness might do much to remove the evils which spring from the
                    system of patronage and favouritism, and it asserts that
                    the interposition of the British Parliament is more imperiously
                    required. It concludes as follows:–" Deeply penetrated
                    with these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to have changes
                    speedily effected, the loyal subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper
                    Canada now take the extraordinary step of sending home
                    Commissioners to bear this to the throne, and humbly intreat your Royal
                        Highness to give ear to the details which it will be in
                    their power to relate: above all, that your Royal Highness would
                    immediately send out to this province a commission, consisting of
                    discreet</p>
         <p>and wise men, men of business and talent, who shall be above every
                    influence here, and who may be instructed to make inquiry into all the
                    sources of evil.</p>

         <p>American Papers</p>
         <p>From the Trenton Federalist, June 8</p>
         <p>"The seizure, trial, and execution of two men, said to be British subjects,
                    by our military folks, who lately invaded, the Spanish Territory,
                    seems to be confirmed by accounts from the south, with a lament added
                    thereto, that another of the same nation had not been catched and
                    killed. If these accounts should prove true, I think the President
                    will as good reason for recommending to Congress, at the next session,
                    the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, for doing away the
                    naval forces on the lakes– because it was more likely to involve us
                    in war, than to give us security and peace. A little while ago we made
                    quite a bluster and noise because the King of Spain had
                    imprisoned one of our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to rest
                    very easy at present with the above named executions. Why?–because
                    the wrong is committed by us, not against us."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, June 2. 1818:–" The
                    British Consul-General, A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Europe; the ostensible cause of his departure is the recovery
                    of his health, but it is sufficient to look in his face to see that it is
                    only a common diplomatic disease, which may be aggravated or
                    cured at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the English
                    Cabinet has expressed some hesitation in regard to certain subjects in Mr
                    Bagot's dispatches ; the speculation carrying on between the
                    Spanish agents and some persons in this place opens a field of
                    corruption so wide and comprehensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to
                    state the facts, from his immediate knowledge ; for no man is better
                    acquainted with men and things here.– The Chevalier Colonel
                    Sarmiento is also preparing to visit Madrid, but his business
                    appears to relate to mercantile affairs of some Americans
                    on the west coast ; he received 27,000 dollars for one service
                    of this king, but the object for which he received the douceur failed, and
                    he will not refund."</p>

         <p>Washington, May 25, 1818. SIR–The act of Congress, "concerning
                    navigation," hereto annexed, which is to take effect the first day of
                    October next, so materially changes the commerce of the United States
                    with the colonies and territories of Britannic Majesty, thata
                    due regard to the convenience and interest of those engaged in it requires
                    that the construction of the act should at this time be determined.</p>
         <p>According to the term used un ther the first section of the act, every port
                    or place in the British colonies and territories in the West Indies, and on
                    the continent of America, must be considered as closed against vessels of
                    the United States, to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to
                    carry on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is now, or
                    shall be, carried on in British vessels between the ports of the United
                    States and the ports of any British colony or territory.</p>
         <p>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the United States to go
                    in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring away salt, or to carry certain
                    articles to one or more of the Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a
                    few other articles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of
                    those islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the
                    intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are permitted
                    to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to vessels of the United
                    States.</p>
         <p>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the first section
                    applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or with cargoes.</p>
         <p>The form of the bond required by the second section of the act is hereunto
                    annexed. It is expected that proper circumspection will be
                    exercised in requiring a security, as much of the efficacy of the act will
                    depend upon the judicious discharge of this part of your
                    duty.</p>

                    victory at Coxeder, eleven leagues from St Carlos, over Paez, who had
                    under his command about 1500 cavalry, and 600 or 800 infantry, out of which
                    1000 men were killed, and 400 horses and three stand of colours taken.

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>The inhabitants of Upper Canada have had another meeting, under the title of
                    a Convention at York ; when they came to the following resolutions ; Richard Beasely, Esq. in the chair :–</p>
         <p>"Resolved–1. That whilst this Convention holds it one one of the most
                    sacred right of British subjects at all times directly to
                    petition the throne of their Sovereign relative to their grievances, yet
                    nevertheless, under the present peculiar existing circumstances
                    of this country, the Members of this Convention, as well out of respect to
                    that Honourable Body the Commons House of Assembly of Upper Canada, as for
                    other causes, deem it their indispensable duty, on this important
                    occasion, to recommend in the strongest terms to their fellow subjects
                    resident in this province, a spirit, formal, and respectful
                    application to that Honourable House, for an inquiry into the state of the
                    province.</p>
         <p>"2. That John Clarke Cyrus Sumner, and Roderick Drake, Esqs. be a permanent
                    Committee, for the management of the affairs of the Convention,
                    and that they, as soon as may be practicable, prepare a respectful
                    petition, praying for inquiring, and expressive of grievances (for the
                    sanction of this Convention), to be by them circulated for subscribers,
                    and presented at the bar of the House of Assembly at their next
                    meeting session.</p>
         <p>That the said Committee be further authorised to frame and Address to his
                    Royal Highness the Prince Regent, on the subject of grievances believed to
                    exist in Upper Canada, which, when approved of by the
                    Convention, shall be submitted by the Committee, together with
                    the petition above mentioned, to the Honourable House of Assembly, at their
                    next meeting, for their alterationg and amendment."</p>
         <p>Mr Gourlay, who has had so instrumental a hand in instigating these
                    proceedings, is stated to have been arrested and held to bail, at Kingston, for distributing a printed account of the state of
                    grievances of the people of the Niagara district ; and this by direction of
                    the AttorneyGeneral of the province, who is reported to have
                    influenced the Justice who signed the warrant, by certain threats of
                    vengeance if he refused. Another report is mentioned as being in circulation, namely, that official instruction have been sent to
                    particular Magistrates, to take notice of, and transmit to Government, the
                    names of all persons holding commissions, civil or military, who
                    engage in the measures of petitioning the Prince Regent, as recommended by
                    Mr Gourlay, in order that they may be removed from their
                    offices.</p>
         <p>"The Upper Canada Convention met at York on the 6th inst. under the
                    Presidency of Richard Bearly, Esq. J. P. It has styled itself a
                    Convention of Friends to Free Inquiry, and resolved to change the proposed
                    plan of sending deputies to England with a petition to his Royal
                    Highness the Prince Regent, confining itself to an application to the
                    House of Assembly for an inquiry into the state of the province, and a
                        petition to his Royal Highness, to be presented to Sir

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>Emigration to America</p>
         <p>Our paper of Thursday last contained a general view of some of
                    the most popular publications on the subject of emigration, and we shall
                    now endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the good and evil which
                    is likely to befall those who embark in this hazardous adventure.</p>
         <p>There is one important fact which we gather from all the accounts of
                    America, whether written for the purpose of praise or censure,
                    namely, that there is a great demand for labour, and that wages are
                    high, and this effect is necessarily produced y the vast space of fertile
                    and unoccupied territory which lies westward of the United
                    States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is this vacant territory which is the
                    true spring of this American community. Here is the grand outlet for the superflouous population both of the eastern states
                    of America and of Europe. To cultivate this waste there is a constant
                    demand for new labourers ; wages are, of course, high –
                    the labourer lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he becomes in his turn a purchaser of land from the savings which he accumulates. If labour should become more
                    plentiful, and wages should fall, this is the signal for new emigrations ;
                    and thus, this constant demand for labour in the western
                    districts regulates its general price throughout the United States. In
                    these circumstrances it is clear that a labourer, provided he can reach
                    this advantageous market for his labour, will unquestionably
                    improve his condition. But herein lies the difficulty. A
                    labourer has seldom the means of of subsistence so far beforehand as to
                    enable him to undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters upon the
                    enterprise with insufficient means, he is liable to starve before he can
                    transport himself to his ultimate destination, or he is forced
                    to contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations little short of
                    servitude, under the weight of which he is grievously oppressed. These,
                    then form strong objections to emigrations in the case of those who
                    are stinted to their means ; but where these objections can be surmounted,
                    those who can transport their labour from the overstocked
                    market of Europe to the understocked market of America, will unquestionably
                    dispose of it to better advantage ; but if they have not the means,
                    they may as furely fail in the attempt, and draw upon themselves
                    aggravated misery and want. As to the consequences of emigration to this country, we hold them rather to be
                    beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily account for
                    the very absurd alarm which has been propagated on this subject. The evil
                    in Europe is, that every country is overcrowded with labourers, who
                    cannot find employment ; and is it not manifest, therefore, that
                    the withdrawing of some of these will make more room for the labourers that
                    remain – that the loss of those useless hands will rather be a
                    relief to the body politic, and will diffuse greater soundness and vigour
                    through all its parts? That these effects will follow from emigration
                    in this or in any other country in Europe we cannot doubt – and that
                    the labourer, if he can afford the expence of the journey, will receive higher wages in America than in this country, is equally clear.</p>
         <p>There is another class of adventurers who may possibly improve their
                    circumstances by emigration, although this is not so certain, namely, farmers with a moderate capital. An allotment of land may be purchased in the back parts of America at the
                    Government price of two dollars per acre, and an emigrant who
                    can afford to but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and acts with
                    proper judgement and skill, may undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort,
                    be sure of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigrations from the eastern states, the country being quickly settled all
                    around him, his property is daily improving in value. But a want of
                    judgement in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the land
                    after it is purchased, may involve him in irrecoverable distress
                    and ruin ; and to avoid these hazards no little discrimination and prudence
                    is necessary.</p>
         <p>Such are some of the most striking advantages of emigration, and we shall
                    now state some of its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, is
                    the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of subsisting until the land
                    which is purchased yields its first produce. The country is partly open
                    ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is covered with
                    almost boundless forests. A settlement in the woods requires
                    incredible labour to clear it – labour is dear, and not easily
                    procured, and this herculean task naturally devolves on the head of
                    the family, who is forced during the day to ply the axe in this laborious
                    drudgery of felling trees, and afterwards to follow the chace
                    for a meal to his family. Here he must frequently sleep out in the
                    woods ; and his body, exhausted with his day's labour, is exposed to the
                    cold dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his health
                    declines, and it is obvious that his family, deprived even for a single day
                    of his exertions, must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. In
                    many parts the country which is marked out for emigrants is extremely
                    unhealthy, in particular the banks of all the navigable rivers,
                    which afford the most eligible settlements both in point of fertility
                    and situation, are exposed to the most fatal maladies. The same causes
                    which produce fertility produce disease. The overflowing of the
                    waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, fertilise the land in a most
                    wonderful degree ; but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, under a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as the
                    deposits which they leave are favourable to the soil. Hence the many minute
                    directions which are given to all emigrants in regard to their health.
                    In a letter contained in the Emigrant's Guide, we have the
                    following advice to those who are descending the Ohio : " If the
                    weather becomes warm, guard well against the smell of bilge water. But
                    if you must descend in the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and
                        remember you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the
                    havoc, and I believed it not till then." Again it is observed, " Let
                    nothing tempt you to fish in warm weather, immediately on changing your
                    climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison." To a European emigran
                    the climate must be, of course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore
                    lose his health, or he must be continually tormented with anxiously
                    taking care of it, which makes it a question whether it is worth having on
                    such terms. Such are the hardships through which, if he has strength
                    to endure them, he at length emerges into ease and independence. These
                        hardships, however, will no doubt be in a great measure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has beforehand provided the means of subsistence until he can derive regular
                    supplies from his own land. In this case he is less liable to be
                    dislodged from his situation by the casualties to which all emigrants
                    are necessarily exposed. – He is secured against the hardships of a
                    first settlement, and is more certain of attaining the wished for object of ease and affluence – To a farmer,
                    therefore, or a labourer, emigration presents a fair chance of a
                    permanent settlement, provided it is gone about with ordinary
                    caution, and the necessary degree of energy be exerted to insure
                    success. But it is a gross delusion to imagine that an elysium
                    is to be found in the United States, or that mankind exist there on
                    any more favourable terms than in this country, and those who set out
                    on any such visionary schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappointment. With regard to other classes of society, it does not
                    appear that they will improve their condition by emigration to
                    America ; there is no demand for clerks or professional men of
                    any sort, and no merchant has any thing to expect by removing his capital to the United States. In the back settlements there is a
                    demand for schoolmasters to teach the ordinary branches of education, and
                    several emigrants of this class have met with good encouragement.</p>
         <p>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it is apparent, from all the
                    best information on the subject, that a person long resident in this
                        country would change for the worse by an emigration to the United States. He would, in the first place,
                    suffer extremely from the climate, from the extreme cold of winter and the
                    raging heat of summer, the thermometer frequently standing at 98
                    degrees in the share, with a clear sky and broiling sun, and very little
                    abatement of this exsessive heat being experienced through the
                    night. His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, though unsettled
                    climate of this country, runs the risk of being debilitated by the change,
                    and at all events he must suffer extremely in his enjoyments and in
                    his spirit from this cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the manners of the people in the back parts be found very
                    agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all hands, both by those who are
                    favourable and those who are unfavourable to the Americans, that if
                    there is not, as in Europe, gross ignorance and debasement on
                    the one hand, neither is there on the other any thing much exalted
                    above the ordinary level. But the inferences which arise from this
                    established fact are strongly in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice
                    and ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corruptions in
                    the disgust which it excites : such examples are not so potent to debase,
                    as examples of a different sort are to purify and exalt.
                    There is little risk that society will be contaminated by what is low and
                        debased ; but on the other hand, there is a certainty that what is exalted and illustrious in literature, science, taste, accomplishments, or fashion, will exercise a
                    powerful influence on the general state of manners. We naturally copy
                    what we admire, and those great and shining examples constitute
                    a standard to which the whole system of life and manners has a tacit
                    reference. In the United States they have no such models – they do
                    not aim at so high a standard, and taste and manners are therefore
                    necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – Hence all accounts
                    agree in reprobating the extreme filthy habits which universally
                    prevail ; and Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great partiality
                    to this country, draws a contrast between the inhabitants of
                    Hampshire and those of the United States, in which he places this vice
                    of the American manners in strong colours ; and he adds, as his reason
                    for this, that they have no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements
                    of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the country, as models
                    of taste and neatness for the inferior classes, and it is to the same
                    principles that we may trace other defects in their manners, namely,
                    that they have no proper models on which to form themselves. Hence,
                    excepting in the principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all
                    the information we have received on the subject, that society has not
                    reach the same degree of refinement as in this country.</p>
         <p>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain would also feel the disavantages
                    of American society strong in this, that here, in so
                    closely peopled a community, surrounded with all sorts of refinements,
                    life is assisted by such a variety of helps, that it glides down the
                    smooth stream of comfort and convenience, without ever
                    meeting with a single interruption. It is astonishing to what a pitch of
                    improvement a society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all the
                    mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of thousands is incessantly on the
                    rack to set on foot new devices for the common good. We are not duly
                    sensible of the advantages of this, because, like other advantages, they
                    are familiar to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine that they
                    are inherent in the natural constitution of things. But when we are
                    suddenly transplanted into a new community, abounding indeed in subsistence, but deficient in all comforts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are practised
                    – where the inhabitants are so widely dispersed, that
                    their common exertions cannot be made available for the common good,
                    we find life interrupted at every turn. In our former society, if we had
                    not the previous secret of transmuting all things into gold, we had at
                    least the power of transmuting gold into every thing else. But here the
                    power of money is limited. We must indeed pay for services, but we
                    must also beg for them ; and thus we go on fretting and tormenting
                    ourselves under petty incommodities, which in this country would be
                    remedied as soon as they were felt. It is inconceivable how much inconvenience and discomfort and real
                    unhappiness may spring from this cause. In this country, by long habit and
                        pracrice and continual improvement, every thing has
                    fallen into its right place – each individual has a separate
                    task assigned him in the joint task of labouring for the general benefit
                    – and the industry of all, however variously directed,
                    tends to one common end. There is a perfect unity of effort. We all
                    labour in common – we combine our efforts that they may
                    yield the largest possible produce, and this produce is accurately
                    shared among the various members of the community, each
                    receiving the share to which his labour entitles him. Such is substantially
                    the process by which commerce diffuses the benefits of industry over
                    every civilized community. – Money is the instrument by which this
                    division is effected. Every one who labours has the value of his
                    labour ascertained in money, which is a draft upon the common stock for
                    whatever quantity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to
                    ; and all these complicated operations are executed with a
                    regularity almost mechanical. But in a community newly forming there is a
                    want of unity and combination – all the members labour indeed,
                    but no one has his proper part assigned him – there is a jostling
                    and an interference with each other – and when they come to divide,
                    some have too much, and some too little, of certain
                    articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money will not execute its functions. Hence disorder arises, and inconvience
                    and awkward wants, and an individual suddenly removed into this region
                    of discomfort from the happier climate of a highly improved community, must
                    be annoyed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy and
                    disagreeable. He must have the same sensation as a person who
                    quits an elegant mansion, fitted up with every comfort and convenience,
                    for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, where he is exposed
                    to a thousand annoyances every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson,
                    that the evil of life does not consist in any sudden and
                    overwhelming crash of misery, but in a series of petty discomforts amd
                    mischiefs continually preying upon the temper. The truth of
                    this maxim, those who emigrate from this country to the
                    back woods of America, will have a good opportunity of verifying.</p>
         <p>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States of the Union constitutes
                    another capital defect in the structure of American society. These
                    slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, in the tyranny
                    exercised over them, they themselves are morally destroyed,
                    while the corruption extends to the other orders of society, equally
                    infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and debasing the general
                    character and habits of the people. It is vain to talk of liberty while
                    stain of tyranny so deeply infects the domestic manners of
                    a community. There can be no rational liberty unless we call that
                    liberty which gives us the privilege of torturing and
                    oppressing our fellow creatures. To give an idea of the consequences of
                    this dreadful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a
                    practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves into the hands of the
                    public executioner, by whom they are unmercifully flogged at the markey cross of the different towns, the streets being filled
                    with their pietous cries. What can we think of the people where such
                        spectacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so
                    utterly revolting to every just and enlightened feeling, that to a
                    European it would form a strong objection to his permanent residence in
                    that country. In all the northern states, and in some of the new
                    states, particularly that of the Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in
                        several others the black form a large proportion of the
                    population, and they are not decreasing. We know indeed that this evil is
                    admitted in its full extent by all the American statesmen, that they
                    lament it, but do not well see what measures can be adopted to check it.
                    The importation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but the
                    increase of those already in the country is the great grievance, against
                    which it is difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and oppressive
                    treatment which slaves will always meet with wherever they exist, must tend
                    to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the community at large. To
                    such, therefore, as are accustomed to European society, where no such
                    strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, an exchange into a
                    community where his feelings may be revolted by spectacles of
                    gross cruelty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more
                    imperious considerations permit, they have certainly a
                    greater chance for happiness by remaining where the rights of
                    nature are respected, than by removing to a society where every principle
                    of humanity is trampled upon.</p>

         <p>Interesting Communication from Canada</p>
         <p>To the Editor of the Edinburgh Weekly Journal</p>
         <p>SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of
                    1815, proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to
                    Canada.–Having myself occasion to visit this country, I was curious
                    to know what had been the result, especially as I found at Quebec and Montreal
                    very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people asserting that the
                    scheme had failed of success, and that the settlers were in a state of great
                    discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my
                    route about 50 miles, and spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters
                    of the Redeau, to which a considerable body of the people who accepted the
                    invitation of the Government had been conducted.– Here it traced the
                    reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and some ill
                    conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious of
                    their rights ; but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the
                    settlers, and a strong feeling of the good intentions of Government towards
                    them. The opportunity being a good one of ascertaining the
                    progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I
                    constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to
                    prove to correctness of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation.
                    Should you think this worthy of publication, you are welcome to publish it in
                    your paper. It may draw attention of a most important subject–the
                    colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford
                    satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of
                    their friends. The scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive.
                    The settlers had a free passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools
                    were furnished to those who came out ; and this year multitudes of poor
                    people have come to Canada, in expectation of being favoured in the same way,
                    but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100 acres each),
                    which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study,
                    during three months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country,
                    and into every particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very
                    simple measures might be adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain
                    could be conveyed by a regular flow into Canada, instead of being wasted,
                    as it now is, to the great prejudice of British interest, over the whole of
                    American ; and were such measures adopted, this province would, in a very
                    few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States

      <text>
         <p>Convicts destined for Botany Bay.–It is now
                    seven weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several
                    others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany Bay.
                    They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retribution, put
                    on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to land them at their place of
                    punishment. The number on board that ship, on leaving Sheerness, was
                    between 2 to 300, many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition
                    has been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay that
                    has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceeded farther
                    than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some accident or other. She
                    returned to Sheerness, where she now lies, and where she is likely to lie
                    for some time, upon the pretence that the loss she has sustained
                    is a justification for delay, however protracted. The unfortunate inmates
                    have been led to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence
                    has taken place ;–so that between the suspense, and the terrible
                    species of confinement to which they are subject, their sufferings are hardto be described.–Observer.</p>
         <p>The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.–It is with the
                        greatest concern we have to mentioned the death of
                    Lieut.-Colonel Erskine, Lord Erskine's youngest son, on his passage to Ceylon. He served
                    throughout the campaigns in Spain as a Captain of Light Infantry in the
                    51st regiment, and behaved with great gallantry in the battle of
                    the Pyrenees, where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medical Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of
                        York on the Staff of the Army in the
                    Adjutant-General's Department when the Duke of Wellington took the command in Flanders. He was in the
                    battle of the 16th of June, and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of
                    Waterloo, where his station placed him in the dangerous position of being
                        attendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was
                    either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young man had
                    his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which passing along
                    the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost the use of two of his
                    fingers, but that arm was saved. When the cannon-shot had thrown him from
                    his horse, and as he lay bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition,
                    the Prussian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he
                        seized his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving
                    it round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying and the
                    dead, the Duke of Wellington being then close by
                    him who desired he might carried to his tent.</p>
         <p>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he must have
                    distinguished himself in the opinion of his great Commander, as he was
                    immediately recommended by him for the rank of Major, though a very young
                    officer, and in a year afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with
                    the appointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had
                    then fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been
                    saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was animated, he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs Erskine, who was pregnant, and remaining here
                    during the winter, the cough, with consumptive symptoms, arising from his
                    wound, laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage,
                    and he died on his passage to India.</p>
         <p>Colonel Erskine was only 25 years of age, and has left
                    three sons and a daughter, and an infant a few months old.</p>
         <p>The marriage of the Duke of Clarence with the rich
                        heiress Miss Wykeham is said to be
                    finally arranged ; and from what we observe, it is not likely to suffer any
                    delay from the late domestic calamity. it is said that the Prince Regenthas given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed through
                    the constitutional forms, and that the Royal Assent inCouncil has been given we do not pretend to know. It
                    must have that sanction to secure the Lady the right, for herself and
                    heirs, of succeeding to the Throne. On this interesting subject it cannot
                    be forgotten, that King in Council refused his assent in three former instances.</p>
         <p>The refusal of the Princess Royal of Denmark arrived in
                    town on Monday or Tuesday last week. On Wednesday it was communicated
                    to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence, and on Thursday he set off to Brighton, offered his hand
                    to Miss Wykeham, and " was a thriving wooer."</p>
         <p>Colonel Henry Fitzclarence, the son of the Duke of Clarence, lately deceased, was a young
                    man of uncommon energy of character, and of talents and
                    acquirements. In the affair of the 10th Light Dragoons, he
                    displayed a spirit of independence and manliness the most
                    honourable. He was an admirable linguist, and, as we understand,
                    was about to return to England, with the view of being employed in the
                        Diplomacy, for which he was peculiarly qualified.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Death of The Duke of Richmond.</p>
         <p>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we have advices from thence
                    of the 4th September, three days later than the last accounts. They
                    confirm, we regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on
                    Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at Montreal, where he
                    had arrived on his return from inspecting the new settlements in
                    Upper Canada. His body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, where
                    it was lying in state at the time the Henry sailed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in the most afflicting
                    state, and great fears were entertained for her recovery.</p>
         <p>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, is married to Major-General
                    Sir Peregrine Maitland. They accompanied his grace to North America, and
                    have remained there since he entered upon his Government.
                    His Grace was the lineal descendant of the first Duke of Richmond, natural
                    son of King Charles II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty
                    Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, Duchess of
                    Aubigny, in France. His titles were, Duke of Richmond, Early of March
                    (English honours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke
                    of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of Torbulton (Scots
                    Honours). The title of Aubigny was confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII
                    by causing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and
                    granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by his Grace's
                    ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army, Colonel of the 35th
                    regiment of foot, Gonervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and
                    Lower Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of the county of
                    Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. –His Grace was born in 1764,
                    succeeded his uncle, Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783
                    Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom he had issue seven sons
                    and seven daughters, all of them now living, except his third son, Henry
                    Adam, R. N. who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into Port
                    Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace was distinguished early in life
                    by a duel with His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an open,
                    candid, generous temper, and of plain and unaffected manners,
                    qualities which were particularly conspicuous in Ireland, when
                    Viceroy of that country.</p>
         <p>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest son Charles, Earl of March,
                    now Duke of Richmond. This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active
                        service under the personal auspices of the illustrious
                        Wellington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and
                    was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the City of
                    Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes vacant. He was lately
                    married to the eldest daughter of the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a
                    Son, now Earl of March.</p>
         <p>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers:</p>
         <p>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. "This Province has again been visited by one of
                    those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by separating by
                    the hand of death, the ruler from the people, covers whole communities with
                    mourning.</p>
         <p>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from Montreal, with the
                    afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace the Duke of Richmond, Governor
                    in Chief of these Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Montreal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to join
                    his family there, from which he had separated in good health at Kingston,
                    one the 20th, to complete by visiting the new Settlements, the long and
                    arduous journey in which he has been engaged.</p>
         <p>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelligence, spread with
                    the greatest rapidity, and impressed a deep gloom throughout the city. The
                    flag on the citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted
                    half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public mourning.</p>
         <p>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, was conveyed to Montreal. It
                    reached this city last evening in the steam-boat Malsham, and was removed this forenoon to the Castle,
                    with the usual military honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the
                        principal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Garrison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."</p>
         <p>September 5. "His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal to
                    Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the morning of the 2d of Sept.
                    they were removed from the vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's
                    Wharf at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Chateau
                    of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'clock on
                    Saturday the 4th September, when they were removed to the place of
                    internment in the Cathedral Church at Quebec.</p>
         <p>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and insignia of the Order of
                    the Garter, with his Grace's military and other appointments being placed
                    on the coffin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its
                    being placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms
                    reversed.</p>
         <p>"The procession then moved forward. It was composed of all the
                    principals persons attached to the public, military and civil
                    departments.</p>
         <p>"The military band filed off at the door of the Cathedral
                    Church-yard and conducted it up the centre aisle, when it was played on a
                    platform, the mourners remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when
                    the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When I wrote the first
                    side, I did not expect so soon to communicate the melancholy
                    event of the death of our Governor, the Duke of Richmond, who
                    was attacked on his route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydrophobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles
                    from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly sensible of his
                    situation, and gave himself up from the first spasm which attacked : it was
                    occasioned by a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Canada, about three months since. His death, at this
                    juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this country, as he possessed the entire confidence of Government, and
                    was about completing a plan of defence for the Canadas, which, when
                    executed, would establish a water communication with our extreme points,
                        perfectly free from interruption, in case of a war with the
                    States."</p>
         <p>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his Grace's family was so
                    dangerously ill, as was at first reported. They are only in that situation
                    which might be expected, from so severe an affliction.</p>
         <p>Colonel Wilson had succeeded the late Duke of Richmond as
                    Governor-General of both Canadas, being the senior Officer on that
                    station.</p>
         <p>Sir Charles Saxton, and Major M'Leod, Aides-de Camp to his Grace
                    the Duke of Richmond, have gone to Lake Winnipeg, clothed with special
                    powers, to investigate the causes of the unhappy dissentions
                    which are said to have been lately renewed in that quarter between the
                    North West and Hudson's Bay Company. By the new act, regulating the
                    commercial intercourse between the province of Upper Canada and the United
                    States, the duties on the importation of manufactures and provisions
                    from the States are considerably reduced on [?] of the
                    enumerated articles, although on nails, snuff, manufactured tobacco, and
                    spirits, they are riased. The ad-valorem[?] duty is
                    reduced from 10 to 5 per cent.</p>
         <p>Buffalo, Aug. 4. On Friday, came[?] on before the Court of King's
                    Beach, at Niagara, the trial of Robert Gourlay, Esq. for a
                    misdemeanour, in not obeying the orders of the Magistrates at Niagara, in
                    December last. Mr Gourlay was found guilty, and banished the
                    province.</p>
         <p>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August: This morning, about 9 o'clock,
                    Lieut. Birch, of the royal navy, put a period to his existence by shooting
                    himself through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch had for
                    sometime previous to his death laboured under a melancholy state of mind.
                    An amiable[?] wife and one child are the survivors[?] of this awful [?] The Annual Report of the Agricultural Society of Quebec has been
                    published from which it is evident that a laudable spirit of enterprise has
                    been awakened in that important country. The Committee, who, in the
                    execution of their functions travelled through the greater part of Lower
                    Canada, conclude their Report by putting on record a testimony they justly
                    conceive to be honourable to the character of the inhabitants of the
                    country through which they passed. Although many hundreds of persons
                    from all parts of their respective Counties attended the Agricultural
                    Meetings, which were frequently of four or five hours duration, there
                    did not occur at any of them a single instance of intoxication, disorderly conduct or personal altercation.</p>
         <p>The Grand Jury at Nassau, New Providence, have brought in a bill against Sir
                    Gregor M'Gregor, charging him with aiding and abetting piracy, by issuing
                        commissions in the Bahamas, to subjects of Power in
                    unity[?] with Spain.</p>
         <p>A letter from Sierra Leone, dated the 9th of March says–" It is with
                    the deepest regret I inform you that, notwithstanding the liberality of
                    Great Britain, and the faith of Treaties, the coasts swarms with slave
                    vessels, dragging thousnads of its miserable inhabitants into endless
                    captivity. A few days ago arrived here the Union, of Liverpool : the
                    Supercargo states, that during his stay in the river Calabia, not less than
                    eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves each, had sailed for the Spanish
                    Colonies."</p>
         <p>We have received Gibraltar Chronicles to the 10th
                    ult. from which we learn that, in consequence of the rapid increase of
                    the fever at the Isle de Leon, his Excellency Governor Don had
                    issued a Proclamation on the 2d ult. announcing that all communications
                    with Spain (except through the customary process of quatine) would close at sun-set on the following evening. Notice
                    was also given to such of the labouring classes as had not passed the
                    fever, that they would be provided with tents and encamped on the neutral
                    ground for their better security against infection should it unhappily appears in the fortress. They would not be suffered
                    to proceed to town, and follow their callings, during the day, but
                    heir return to the encampment at night was peremptorily enjoined.</p>
         <p>We are happy to learn, however, by the latest advices from the British
                    fortress, that the garrison and inhabitants were not at all
                    infected with the disease.</p>

         <p>Emigration to America.</p>
         <p>In answer to the remarks which appeared in our paper on Monday last,
                    respecting emigration to America, and to the statements there given of
                    the disadvantages which emigrants from this country might expect to meet
                    with, we have received a very abusive letter from an anonymous correspondent, who appears very angry, and, like most other angry
                    men, seems more anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to assign any good reason for it. His first cause of quarrel is,
                    that we have stated the general want of cleanliness to be a prevailing
                    defect in the back parts of the United States. For this we have the
                    authority of almost every traveller who has visited those parts. The
                    remarks of Birkbeck on this point are conclu-sive and striking:
                    –</p>
         <p>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and ' sketching, in a rude manner,
                    as I pass along, ' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem'
                    ing it national, though I know it admits of ve' ry many
                    individual exceptions. I have written ' it, and then erased it, wishing to
                    pass it by, ' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth
                    ' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too ' often in person, is
                    neglected to a degree which ' is very revolting to an Englishman.</p>
         <p>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a ' reproach – for the
                    origin is most honourable ; ' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn
                    ' logs for a framed building, and that again for ' a mansion of brick,
                    some of her cabin habits ' have been unconsciously retained. Many have
                    ' already been quitted, and one by one they will ' all be cleared
                    away, as I am told they are now ' in the cities of the eastern states.</p>
         <p>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which ' are also made us of as places
                    of worship, in ' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating ' ever
                    since they were built. What reverence ' can be felt for the majesty of
                    religion, or of ' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The '
                    people who are content to assemble in them ' can scarcely respect each
                    other. Here is a bad ' public example. It is said that to clean those
                    ' places is the office of no one. But why is no ' person appointed ?
                    Might it not be inferred ' that a disregard to the decencies of life
                    prevails ' through such a community?'</p>
         <p>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the ' general (for there are many
                    exceptions) sloven' liness about the homsteads, and particularly
                    ' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck ' complains of this,
                    and indeed what a contrast ' with the homesteads and cottages which he left
                    ' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild' ford, in
                    Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the reasons for this. When the first
                    settlers took possession of the country, the ' example of neat' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were ' no
                    gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as ' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as
                    a car' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec'
                    tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who ' never have seen or heard of
                    perfection in these ' matters, will naturally be slovens.'</p>
         <p>He afterwards remarks –</p>
         <p>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect ' show of cleanliness. Not even a
                    carter without ' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven ' and
                    clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, ' who came from this very spot,
                    think the people ' dirty in the western country.
                    I'll engage he ' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one '
                    family of his present neighbours, than he left ' behind upon the skins of
                    all the people in ' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he '
                    would not have found this to be the case in ' Pennsylvania, and especially
                    in those parts where ' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in '
                    the New England States, the people are as ' cleanly and as neat as they are
                    in England. ' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu'
                    trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the ' nastiest thing in
                    nature.'</p>
         <p>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells us, that the Scotch are very
                    dirty. This, we admit, was formerly, and may still continue in some
                    degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. But does this reasonable person
                    mean to argue from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and ought not
                    to be corrected.</p>
         <p>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a settlement, we are borne out
                    in our remarks on this subject by the authority of various writers,
                    and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's Guide, a work of
                    great merit, which combines an extent and precision of statistical
                        information altogether unequally, with the most enlarged general views of the state of the country, both
                    physical and moral. ' Most men (observes ' this judicious writer) on
                    arriving in the United ' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only '
                    essential advantages offered are the security of ' person and property, and
                    the cheapness of land. ' It demands excessive labour, severe economy,
                    ' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to ' succeed in a newly
                    settled country ; and it de' mands the permanency of this
                    continued la' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.'</p>
         <p>Our anonymous correspondent is also extremely displeased that we
                    have stated so strongly the perincious effects produced on the
                        general manners of the Americans by the existence of
                    slavery ; and he mentions that many a labourer in this country
                    might envy the condition of an American slave. What are those privileges
                    for which a free man should envy a slave he does not think proper to
                    state. To show, however, that we have not exaggerated the degradation
                    and oppression of the coloured class in the United States,
                    we shall again adduce the authority of the Emigrant's Guide. The author is
                        contradicting the notion that the labourer in the slave
                    States is confounded with the negroe ; and he expresses himself in the
                    following terms: –</p>
         <p>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla' very is prevalent,
                    enables us to contradict a ' general expression, that, in such places,
                    whites, ' performing manual labour, are confounded in ' the moral
                    estimates of the people with slaves. ' Though less respect is certainly
                    paid to useful ' labour in the slave states than where all the '
                    duties are performed by whites, yet ' the distance between the two races of
                    men are ' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and ' inveterate is
                    the feeling on that subject, that ' not any where in the United States can
                        pro' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other '
                    advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi' nion a man the
                    most remotely allied to the ' African, to a rank equal to the meanest
                    white. ' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi' ana
                    will be witness to some very remarkable ' exemplifications of this innate
                    contempt for all ' those who affinity involve them in the con' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.'</p>
         <p>What a picture is here conveyed of misery and degradation on the one hand,
                    and of tyranny on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed
                    that no degree of worth, whether moral or intellectual, not even the possession of property, can give a man the least
                    degree of consideration in the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot
                    conceive a community more wretchedly constituted. All that
                    is estimable and worthy is here utterly contemned, because the individual
                    who possesses these qualities happens to have his skin of a particular
                    colour, and thus a merely accidental quality of the corporeal
                    frame entails upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy and
                    contempt. These distinctions, carried to such an excess, seem to us to be
                    founded on the extinction of every generous and honourable sentiment, and we cannot help still asserting that we had
                    rather live we at present are, than in a community where such hateful
                    antipathies rule to the exclusion of every just and humane
                    feeling.</p>
         <p>With regard to the condition of the negroe slaves we shall quote a passage
                    from Brown's Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory after reading
                    which, we shall leave our anonymous correspondent to say whether
                    he thinks the condition of a labourer in this country preferable to that of being an African slave. The writer, describing the
                    town of Lexington, in Kentucky, observes –</p>
         <p>' In this square stands the market-house, ' which is of brick, and well
                    furnished on Wed' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the
                    ' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here ' that incorrigible
                    or delinquent negroes are ' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment
                    ' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their ' screams soon collected a
                    numerous crowd ; I ' could not help saying to myself, " These cries '
                    are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "</p>
         <p>Having made this answer to the angry charges thus brought against us, we
                    have only to disclaim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or
                        prejudice against the Americans. We have no wish either
                    to depreciate their character or institutions. They exhibit the
                    interesting spectacle of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace
                    to wealth and greatness. To revile such a people would be the height
                    of human folly, and equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to
                    take offence because endeavour to make a fair estimate of their
                    character, without hiding any of its defects.</p>

                    4.</p>
         <p>Lord Selkirk vs. North West Company.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer and Terminer proceeded to
                    try the gentlemen accused as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple,
                    Esq. and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 and the trial
                    was rendered extremely interesting by the disclousure which took place of
                    many extraordinary circumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya
                    and North West Companies, which for some time past has excited so much
                    of the public attention in this Province. The gentlemen tried on
                    this occasion were, Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, Hugh M'Gillis,
                    Simon Fraser, John Macdonald, and John M'Laughlin } accused
                    as accessories after the fact. and Mr John Severlight, accused as an
                    accessory beforeand after the fact.</p>
         <p>It appeared in evidence that the North West Company had been
                    upwards of thirty years in possession of trading posts called forts at different points on the Red River in the
                    Indian Territories, and it is well known that for a century before the
                    North West Company, the Canadian for traders had been in the
                        constant practise of resorting to that country which was
                    visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's Bay Company
                    about twenty-five years ago. It was put in evidence that for many years
                    afterwards both companies carried on their trade to Red River without
                    interference in each others pursuits, and without any disturbance in
                    the country ; and it was explained that the principal object of the trade
                    being to collect provisions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried
                    flesh of the buffalo, which abound in the plains) and the
                    country producing abundance for the supply of both parties, the
                    same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading stations where
                    the fine furs are obtained in small quantities, and where rival
                    traders would at all times be likely to dispute about the divisions of
                    them. The Red River country therefore remained quiet and undisturbed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists and
                    Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders to prevent the usual
                    supplies of provisions from being obtained by the traders.</p>
         <p>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-disant Governor of Ossinibour, prohibiting the exportation of provisions from Red River, was the first document produced for the defence at the recent trials. It was
                    proved that, under this assumed authority, several acts of violence were
                    committed by Mr Macdonnell and his followers. Trading posts and buildings
                    were forcibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river
                    (the only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries mounted with
                    cannon, and the trade of the North West Company wholly interdicted, before
                    any acts of retaliation were attempted on their part, and even before they took any precautions for their own defence or for
                    ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which depended the existence of
                    their trade, and the lives of their people.</p>
         <p>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and retaliation appeared
                    to have exasperated the minds of both parties, and to have rendered them so
                    suspicious of the designs of each other as to be always on their guard
                    and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in evidence that the
                    country remained in a state of private war, which at length
                    ended in the battle of the loch of Jane, 1816. The
                    particulars of this unfortunate affray were fully investigated
                    in the trial of Bouche and Brown for murder, as principals. The statements on both sides are already
                    before the public, and the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently
                    that the jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been the
                    assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories the cirumstances which
                    led to the meeting of the hostile parties were made out in the
                    evidence to the following effect, viz : –</p>
         <p>In March, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an armed
                    party, acting under the orders of GovernorSemple, who had succeeded Governor Miles Macdonnell at Red River, captured by surprise the
                    North West trading post at the forks of the river, called FortGibraltar, and took possession of all the stores and
                    provisions. In the latter part of the following month of May, Governor
                    Semple caused the buildings (which were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and
                    the materials were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in constructing his new fort, which he called Fort
                        Douglasand where, (following the examples of his predecessors) he mounted
                    cannon to command the passage of the river, built an armed schooner, or
                    gun-boat, to complete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the provisions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. Alexander Macdonnell, a
                    partner of the North West Company, who had charge of their provisions at
                        Riviere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River,
                    became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and assembled as many people as he could (half breeds and others) for the
                    protection of the property under his care, with which, at the usual time,
                    he proceeded down the river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor
                    Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made dispositions to
                    defend them, if attacked, and sent a party of his people, with a temporary
                    supply to meet the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages,
                    and concert with them the means of eluding or removing it.
                    This party, under the direction of Cuthbert Grant (a half breed,
                    and a clerk of the N. West Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas
                    in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and to carry these
                    provisions in carts, at as great a distance as possible from the fort, so
                    as to avoid being seen.– This it was fully proved they did ; but a
                    swamp in the rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about two
                    miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from then, the conflict ensued
                    in which Mr Semple, and most of his party, were killed.</p>
         <p>It was further made out in evidence that in the Spring of the year 1816, the
                    agent of the North West Company at Montreal were still in need of more than
                    the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, because
                    there had not yet been time to replace the vessels on the lakes,
                    and the other means of transport which the Americans had destroyed during
                    the war, nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the usual
                    quantity of provisions from Canada. Having also heard of the seizure of one
                    of their posts at Red River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending
                    further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of the agents, with
                    all the partners and clerks who could be spared from Montreal, proceeded up
                    the country early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William,
                    received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar and the
                    blockade of Red River, towards which place he immediately proceeded with as
                    many of the partners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he
                    could collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted
                    provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own defence, if fired
                    on by Semple's blockading battery, it was their avowed purpose to use force
                    if necessary, but it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders
                    issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas singing, and to
                    proceed up the river for their provisions, without landing or
                    molesting any one unless they should be attacked.–They arrived at
                    Red River three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was a
                    Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party had been the
                    assailants, and that the half breeds had only acted in self defence, did
                    not adopt any measures against them, (the half breeds) but, on the
                    contrary, expressed approbation for their having defended their
                    provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. usually
                    given to all the servants of the North West Company, while, at the same
                    time, he arrest some of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served
                        subpoenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions
                    in the Courts of Lower Canada. This was the whole of the evidence, and the only circumstances which
                    appeared relative to the prisoners, were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged
                    accessory before the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he
                    sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions past Fort
                    Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries after the fact arrived at Red
                    River with Mr M'Leod, after the battle was over, and appeared to consider
                    it, as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the
                    unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the successful party
                        were not murderers–The Judge who presided
                    at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury that there was not a scintilla of evidence " against any one of these
                    gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly returned a verdict of Not Guilty.</p>
         <p>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were arrested by the
                    Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug 1815, on the charges of High
                    Treason and Conspiracy, as well as Murder–and that the
                    buildings and property of the North West Company at that place were
                    forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an armed force under his
                    Lordship's command. The North West Company represented at the time that
                    these accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the
                    preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction of their
                    trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it was alleged that the crimes
                    committed by the partners of the North West Company were so atrocious, as
                    to justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and for some time
                    the public opinion remained in suspense as to the real merits of the case.
                    So far as regarded the seizure of property and the interruption of trade,
                    the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Proclamation
                    of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of which the North West Company
                    recovered possession of their property, and re-established their trade ;
                    but that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the crimes
                    alleged against the individuals, to be investigated and decided upon by the
                    law – and until such investigation could take place, much
                    uncertainty necessarily prevailed from the contradictory statements and
                        affidavits which had been laid before the public.</p>
         <p>The recent trials at York however decided the point as to the alleged murders, and the charge of High
                        Treason has never been followed up, nor ever mentioned, since it
                    served the desired purpose, by figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a
                    pretext for seizing and examining the books and private papers of of
                    the North West Company.</p>

         <p>Reform in Upper Canada</p>
         <p>It has been already mentioned that Governor Maitland, on opening the session
                    of the Legislature of Upper Canada, recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the meeting of delegates
                    for obtaining reform in Upper Canada. Accounts from Quebec and
                    Montreal, dated the end of November, state, that in pursuance of this recommendation, the Legislature, on one of the
                    first days of its meeting, appointed a Committee to inquire into
                    the subject, who almost instantly came to the following resolution</p>
         <p>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that some such
                    legislative provision should be enacted as the wisdom of the
                    Imperial Parliament has found it proper to provide to meet
                    similar occasions, to put it out of the power of any designing persons to
                    organize discontent.</p>
         <p>The proceeding appears to have raised the indignation of the
                    Gourlay or reforming party in Upper Canada, as will be seen by the
                    following extract :–</p>
         <p>Montreal, November 21. This legislative provision, it will be immediately perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act, for that was
                    the course pursued in England. We do not believe that there is the
                    most remote necessity for such a measure. We do not hesitate to say,
                    that the members have not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents,
                    in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with the most humiliating
                    servility ; and we feel convinced that it will not be borne with
                    by the people, while they have the control in any way of their
                    representatives. The sentiment therein attempted to be disseminated is an
                    libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. It would sound in our
                    ears like the knell of their liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its
                        adoption would provoke a spirit of resistance, not
                    corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but open and
                    legitimate, which (if the Administration do not take the
                    decision of the question from the people by force, and we believe they
                    cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the constitution
                    of the united province from the injury which it has received by
                    mal-administration.</p>

         <p>New colony in Lower Canada</p>
         <p>The following curious notice is extracted from a Quebec
                    paper:–</p>
         <p>Interesting to thousands! – Colony of Brotherly
                        Union.</p>
         <p>"It is in agitation to found a colony upon the ancient Spartan plan,
                    sanctioned by apostolical usage, of living a common, and enjoying a
                    community of goods. In this establishment, as each will labour for all, and
                    all for each, personal property will be unknown – and all Just of
                        priate gain, engendered by an imperfect organization of
                    society, will be sacrificed at the shrine of public felicity</p>
         <p>"To carry this project into execution, a fertile tract of land, consisting
                    of some thousands of acres, is on the point of being purchased and
                    surveyed</p>

                    religious of political faith.</p>
         <p>"Want of funds will not furnish a reason for excluding any
                    colonist ; and, on the other hand, it will be a fundamental law of this
                    establishment, that whatever property may be, by adventurers, put into the
                    common stock, will be considered as a loan, and refunded to them r
                    their assignees on demand.</p>
         <p>"The colony will be situated within the bounds of Lower Canada, and under
                    the protection and control of his Majesty's Government.</p>

                    requested to address themselves to the subscribers, personally
                    or by letter. They will specify their country, age, profession, number of

         <p>Colonial Intelligence. Halifax, March 13.</p>
         <p>A very numerous and respectable meeting of the inhabitants of
                    this town was held at the Exchange Coffeehouse, on Saturday
                    last, George Grassie. Esq. to the Chair. It was resolved
                    unaminously–That the Legislature be petitioned to
                    authorise the establishment of a bank in Halifax.–That 50,000l be
                    the capital, to be invested in the British funds.–That notes to the
                        amount of 150,000l be issued by the Bank.–That the
                    shares be 100l each, and every five shares, according to a
                    classification, entitled to a vote.–That the Bank be authorised to
                    pay notes presented, either in specie, provincial paper, or bills of
                    exchange on London at the current rate – A Committee was then
                    appointed to prepare the Petition, and cause it to be presetned to the
                    Legislature. The gentlemen present immediately afterwards unanimously
                    agreed to give to the doubloun the value of 4l and to the sovereigh the
                    value 1l, 2s. 6d. currency. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
         <p>York, Upper Canada, Feb. 6.Tex v. The Earl of Selkirk and others</p>
         <p>A bill of indictment, for a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North West
                    Company, and impoverish the partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury,
                    against Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de Lorimer,
                    Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens,
                    late of the De Meuron Regiment ; Captain Frederick Matthey, ditto ; Lieutenant G. A. Fauche, ditto ; Lieutenant Frederick
                    Graffenrad, ditto ; Serjeant Jacob Vichie, ditto ; Captain
                    Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; Lieutenant Alexander
                    Bridport Beecher, late of the Royal Navy ; Doctor John Allen, John Spencer,
                        Donald Macpherson, James Chatelain, John M'Nab, Archibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke.</p>
         <p>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst the numerous overt acts
                    therein set forth, supported by documentary and oral evidence,
                    the following were particularly prominent :– The engaging and armind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the
                    entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, in August, 1816 ;
                    retaining possession of the fort till May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners
                    the partners of the North West Company found there ; getting rid of
                    the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period when no courts
                    are held there, without ever inquiring whether they know anything of the
                    matters to which the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them
                    forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going into the
                    interior, and the returns from coming into Montreal ; possessing themselves
                    of all the books and papers of the concern ; sending away the principal
                    clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, and without
                    having ever followed up the charge ; the pretended sale, by Daniel
                    Mackenzie, of the North West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of
                    continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the North West
                    Company's servants, and commanding them in the King's name ; writing
                    circular letters to the partners and clerks in the interior country,
                        advising them to abandon their trust, alleging that the
                    North West Company were ruined, and to carry the furs to Hudson's Bay
                    ; taking possession of Fort Lake La Pluie, and the property there, and
                    stopping the navigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney General moved
                    the process of the Court against the parties ; and Dr Allen being present,
                    was to be arraigned the following day.</p>
         <p>Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</p>
         <p>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith against Lord Selkirk for false
                    imprisonment.</p>
         <p>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under sheriff of
                    the Western District, and as such, the bearer of a writ of
                    restitution founded upon a verdict of a special jury at Sandwich, in
                    October 1816, and granted by the Magistrate, ordering the
                    restoration of Fort William to the North West Company. He was also the
                    bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his Lordship, Dr Allen,
                    Captain Matthey, and others, upon an information upon oath
                    before a justice of the Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of
                    March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, with which his
                    Lordship refused to comply ; and when the Earl and others were arrested by
                    Mr Smith, upon the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him
                    and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards kept in close
                    custody in the fort under a military guard. A circumstance which added much
                    to the grievous nature of the offence, and which was
                    particularly dwelt upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that
                    whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, Charles de
                    Reinhard, though under an accusation of was at large and keeping a school,
                    though nominally under the surveillance of one or two of his
                        former comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon another part of the evidence for the defence, by which it
                    appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to obtain his
                    liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and breaking his oath of office,
                    by a promise not to molest Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding
                    this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not liberated
                    until the evacuation of Fort William by his Lordship and his forces in May,
                    1818.</p>
         <p>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict in favour of the
                    plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax currency.</p>
         <p>After narrating the military parages, &amp;c. at Richmond, in
                    America, in honour of the 22d of February, a journal says, " A melancholy
                    catastrophe closed the day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England
                    and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engineering.–who has been residing in this city for two or three
                    years, but whose utility was considerably arrested by an unfortunate habit
                    to which he had become addicted–was destined on that day
                    to breathe his last.– In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by
                    the piece of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he exclaimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was about
                    to fire, and immediately after the commanding had given the word " Fire!"
                    Conolonel Tatham presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece,
                    and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally blown to pieces.
                    His body was raised a few feet in the air by the explosion, and he fell
                    upon his face without uttering one word that was heard by the
                    byestanders.– Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circumstances had strip life of much of its attractions in his
                    eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of his death with
                    horroer, and to feel the deepest commiseraton for his melancholy
                    fate. He was a man of great information, of great genius, and of great
                        resource of mine. But to this melancholy end he has
                    arrived."</p>

      <header>Leeds, April 19–We...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Leeds, April 19.–We
                    have been somewhat alarmed here to-day, though no bad consequences have
                    followed, by a most numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and
                    other artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep coming in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Armley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages and it is
                    computed that at one time there were full three thousand of these
                    distressed people assembled, chiefly in Briggate. As many of
                    them marched into the town with great sticks in their hands, they created
                    some little alarm, but their conduct was uniformly peaceable; their
                    complaints were not loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and
                    Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in readiness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, there
                    was not the slightest occasion for their interference. By far the greater
                    number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, and returned to their
                    respective homes. Several respectable gentlemen went among them, to
                    ascertain the motives of their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it
                    does not appear that they have the least disposition to commit
                    any breath of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do
                    in their present state of distress. I understand that an active
                    subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor men to proceed
                    to Canada; and others are said to have expressed their wish to
                    be sent to Botany Bay, provided they can obtain the sanction of Government.
                    The case of these people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers
                    augment daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.</p>
         <p>Chester,April 19.–John
                    Bagguely, John Drummond and Samuel Johnson, convicted of sedition on the
                    15th inst., were this day, after an adrdress from the Chief-Justice (Mr
                    Serjeant Copley,) sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and to find
                    security for their good behaviour for two years, each in L.500 himself with
                    sureties in L.100 each.</p>
         <p>We are sorry to hear that great number of the agricultural poor
                    are out of employ in Monmouthshire, and that the amount of wages diminishes
                    as works get scarcer. Emigration to America still continues; but
                    it is, for the most part, of a description of person who have afforded
                    employ to others rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some
                    property with them.</p>
         <p>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there are twenty six
                    persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of the name of Thistlewaith,)
                    lately residing in Meadow lane, Leeds. These industrious and enterprising
                    individuals are gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen
                        manufacture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive
                    scale, either at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site
                    in its vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate from
                    the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, Bradford, and other
                    places in the vicinity. It is true these extensive emigrations may, in some
                    degree, contribute to relieve our overburdened population ; but
                    they must likewise tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as
                    every individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecuniary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more
                    consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and industry–articles, at present, of comparative small value
                    in the country.</p>
         <p>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon authors and
                    publishers, by being compelled, under the existing Copyright Act to deliver
                    eleven copies of every book published to certain public
                    libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill to be brought into Parliament
                    in a few days. The body of evidence taken before the Select Committe of the
                    House of Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the
                    state of literary property in this country.</p>
         <p>Saturday last Mr Stuart and Mr Allsop were returned for the Borough of
                    Camelford.</p>
         <p>Yesterday, the Grand Jury for the County of Middlesex found two Bills of
                    Indictment for wilful and corrupt perjury against five of the principal
                    witnesses produced in behalf of the petitioner, who were examined before
                    the Select Committee appointed to try the merits of the election

         <p>Extraordinary Legacy.–A very singular cause is now
                        depending before the Court of Session in Scotland,
                    respecting a legacy to the amount of upwards of fifty
                        thousand pounds,bequeathed by the late Earl of F. (who
                    died at Berlin) to a foreigner, who was one of his domestic
                    servants. The payment of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the
                    late Earl, on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consideration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the
                        subject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The
                    arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which the most
                    eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, display much classical as
                    well as legal learning ; but no judgement has yet been
                    pronounced by the Court. From the magnitude of the sum in
                    dispute, it will probably be finally determined by an appeal to
                    the House of Lords.–Morn. Chron.</p>
         <p>Town Hall, Southwark.–Thomas Wing was brought up by
                    Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], the
                    sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his employers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough,
                    High-street.</p>
         <p>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singular
                    manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was frequently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him take money
                    from the till, which he tied in his pocket handkerchief,
                    followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a shed near the stables,
                    and then he came into the shop and appeared quite restless,
                    pulling every person by the skirt[?] and apparently wishing them to follow
                    him. At length Henry Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the
                    stable, the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the
                    heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to scratch at
                    it till he brought the booty to view ! The apprentice brought it
                    to his master, who counted, and found it to contain 12s. in copper coin.
                    After marking it he desired the boy to place it in the same spot, which he
                    did, and soon afterwards, finding that it was removed, he asked
                    the prisoner some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the
                    whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent for, who, on
                    searching the prisoner, found some of the marked ballpence[?] in his
                    pocket.–Remanded. Bank Committee.–The Opposition Journals, last
                    wek, asserted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House
                    of Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of paying
                    in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January in gold bars at the
                    present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, any quanitity of notes not being
                    less than sixty or a hundred pounds' worth, and that in two years
                    afterwards they shall pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold,
                    L.3, 17s. 10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It recommends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars
                    of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall at all
                    times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, when demanded, at
                    L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d.</p>
         <p>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the Restriction
                    Committee intend to report in favour of payments in bullion at the market
                    price ; and should Parliament adopt that plan ; then there will be a very
                    great saving to the nation in the expense of coinage, the waste
                    of, &amp;c. All the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in
                        foreign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in
                    gold bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run on
                    the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, will be completely
                    prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, the only danger to which it is
                    exposed. A run for coin on the Country Banks would instantly fall on the
                    Bank of England, and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the
                    empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Opposition Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in perfect
                    security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to disorder it.
                    If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase gold bars or foreign coin,
                    or content themselves with silver.</p>
         <p>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the amount of L.800,000
                    each year, and then the value of gold was rather below the standard price.
                    In the year 1817 we imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year
                    1818 we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. During the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have an
                    abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn become necessary,
                    gold will again fall very low. The Bank will then be able to pay, to buy
                    gold to the full extent of Mr Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a
                    firm, unquestionable foundation. The finances of the continent,
                    and of the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will,
                    during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. The East
                    Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quantity of
                    specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her troubles, yields far
                    less than usual. It would be madness to fly in the face of all these
                    circumstances, by compelling the Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may
                    be desirable to limit the issue of bank notes to some certain,
                    yet liberal amount. We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the
                    Committee ; but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?]
                    is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in voting
                    against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be in favour of a very
                    sudden or decided plan for the resumpion of cash payments, or Mr Tierney
                    would not have voted against it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable
                    prospect of a rational scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six
                        Opposition Members of the Committee would not have voted for
                    it. –Courier.</p>
         <p>Grand Pigeon Match, three Gentlemen of the Midgham
                    Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on Farnham
                    Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards distance from the
                    gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. Messrs Adams, Russel and
                    Holt, were selected from the Crack Club against Messrs King, Short and
                    Keans. The sports were as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the
                        remaining two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but
                    lost one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, making
                    a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club was at first backed
                    to win, but the England shots were now backed freely at six to four, as
                    they were considered safe eighteen bird men. Mr King
                    killed twenty, but lost two out of bounds. Short missed his first three,
                    which brought betting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed
                    the next seventeen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had
                    seventeen to tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four
                    and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. He,
                    however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the other four
                    to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once bird. It was altogether
                    the most interesting match of this sort known for years.</p>
         <p>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that Prince Gustavus
                    of Sweden, son of King Gustavus IV., has obtained permission from the
                    Emperor, his uncle, to proceed to England, for the purpose of completing
                    his studies at Oxford. Reports speak highly of the virtues and
                    talents of this unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest
                    and sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must largely
                    share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with which the name of
                        Vasa was connected, not the services rendered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause
                    of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate,
                    whose generosity and magnanimity are proverbial, has settled upon
                    Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per annum, during the
                    residence of the latter in England, and that on the return of his Royal
                    Highness to the Continent he is to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse
                    Cassel, who, if rumour be correct, has lately refused a
                    matrimonial alliance with the new Swedish dynasty.</p>
         <p>Papers arrivedon Saturday from New York and Boston to the 15th ult. The
                    National Intelligencer, in an article occupying five columns,
                    under the head of "Strictures on Mr Lacock's Report on the
                    Seminole War," defends the sanguinary proceedings of General Jackson. This
                    production is said to have excited a great sensation throughout the United
                    States, being supposed to express the sentiments of the Executive. The
                    General had left Washington for his residence in Tenessee. By an
                    arrival from Aux Cayes, intelligence was stated to be received that Sir G
                    M'Gregor's troops had deserted him, owing to the want of funds for their
                    subsistence.</p>

         <p>Some Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in town. Sir Peregrine
                    Maitland had summoned the Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York,
                    on the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in the town of
                    Dunwich, a port of entry, in the same manner as those established between
                    Canada and the United Statess.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town, dated Tobago, Feb. 9.
                    1819.–' The heavy rains which continued during the months of
                    December and January, almost inundated the country, which brought on a
                    most rapid and fatal disease, which made its first appearance in the frost,
                    at a short distance from the town, consisting of 212 men strong, and in 10
                    or 12 days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. The
                    contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into the town, shipping, and
                    country, and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all
                    medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business was nearly
                    suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands, or
                    in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you, that every thing
                    had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious, one man would hardly venture to touch another. The
                    William's crew, from their mutinous disposition, deserted
                    her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has
                    become good within these fifteen days, and the health of the island
                    improving fast.'</p>
         <p>A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes, to the 20th of February, have reached us.
                    They contain no intelligence of particular interest, expect that
                    the colony appears to have been healthy at that period. In one
                    of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way
                    into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that
                    prevailed in that settlement. It states that the "total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818, was eight men,
                    three women, and two children. We lost no civil, military or
                    colonial officer, excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his
                    arrival, and is included in the number."</p>
         <p>A letter from the Havannah, dated 27th February, mentions that the article
                    of coffee is gradually rising in value, and that an agent from Messrs
                    Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million
                    sterling, in that single commodity.</p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from William Hunt, esq." To H.
                        Hunt, esq.</p>
         <p>"Washington Hotel, New Orleans, Dec. 25. 1818.</p>
         <p>"My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth
                    of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a voyage of 82
                    days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health, and very
                    happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great
                    many English emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, in
                    fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind
                    us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river, about 80 miles below
                    New Orleans ; we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting.
                    I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, corner of
                    Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to
                    kill deer, by night coming on, we lost our road ; and, differing
                    in opinions, we separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten
                    o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, and did not
                    return to us till the next morning. It being wet, and Henry sleeping on the
                    marshy ground, in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe
                    cold, and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, but he is
                    now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands
                    of wild swans, wild geese, wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild
                    fowl. If you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, as I
                    know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but
                    they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in
                    England ; this market swarms with them, and very cheap. No game certificate
                    required here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passengers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New Orleans : he has
                    got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon are sugar plantations,
                    sugar-houses, &amp; c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last
                    year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter,
                    as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements
                    on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the
                    worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy, bad managers, and
                    appear to use their negroes very cruel, and work them very hard. The
                    Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, as it is very
                    unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a
                    week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much
                    like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines, and
                    many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church,
                    which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open, and it is a market during the
                    whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, gambling &amp;
                    c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the best in the city ; it is expensive,
                    although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including
                    claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in
                    England, and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July, although
                    not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the
                        election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of
                    them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in
                    this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, and to reap the fair
                    reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for
                    passage, and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three
                    and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the
                    best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be
                    left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the
                    Illinois. Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres of
                    land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him, so
                    that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said
                    that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he
                    tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the
                    Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing
                    wanting there. I should have brought over some with me, but they may follow
                    us ; as I understand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a
                    day, can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of
                    L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I have seen from Illinois,
                    report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says
                    there is a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny per
                    acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour
                    is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts,
                    cravats, pocket handkerchiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a
                    gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my
                    things shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes, yet,
                    from what I have seen hitherto, I like America ten times better</p>

         <p>Emigration to America</p>
         <p>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and respectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819.</p>
         <p>"The best time for coming to America I should judge to be in the summer, to
                    land in September, so as to be able to get here before the weather was
                    too cold. It is safe to settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as
                    to inure to the climate by degrees. The best plan for coming is to
                    take a part of the steerage of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you
                    will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, than would buy a
                    decent farm here. The lands in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and
                    one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is never applied, and is
                    said to be hurtful. It is without question what the land here is as good as
                    can be, and when to this is added the heat of the summer, one ought to
                    be able to raise crops as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10
                    dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not cleared, all the
                    trees under 12 inches are cut down and burned on the ground, and the large
                    ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The ground is then prepared
                    for Indian corn by scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle,
                    which, from the looseness and mellowness of the soil, is easily done,
                    and in this way sixty or eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised.
                    – the trees die in a few months, and in three or four years
                    fall down one by one, and the roots will rot out in seven or eight years.
                    It is a great want of sense in any new settler not to adopt the modes
                    of this country, proven to be the best adapted to the state of it by 200
                    years experience. The Americans, of all other people I know
                    of, are the most ingenious in adapting the means to the end. I do not know
                    if they have more sense than other nations, but they certainly make it go farther. Every tools answers the purpose most effectually.
                    This is evident in their axes. An American will cut down three times
                    more trees and square three times more timber than the best of your
                    wrights could do, and not by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is
                    with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down four acres of wheat in
                    a day, what what he calls a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for
                        binding as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian corn
                    is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels of wheat is about the average
                    of an acre. It is easier farming here than with you on sundry accounts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their appearance,
                    and when ploughed down are certainly killed by the hot sun.
                    There are no frosts to injure the crop, and no wet weather to destroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, and grain is
                    cut one day and stacked or housed the next. From the shortness and mildness
                    of the winter, little provender is needed for the stock. Swine are
                    raised at no expence. They breed and feed in the woods, and only want from
                    one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, when they sell for
                    five cents a lb. In the less settled parts of the country, it is the
                    practise to give all the corn to swine and then send them to market. A
                    bushel of corn is equal in nutriment to a bushel of wheat for man or
                    beast.</p>

      <header>The brig Henry sailed...</header>
      <text>
         <p>The brig Henry sailed from Cork on Wednesday se'ennight,
                    with about two hundred passengers for Aux Cayes, to join Sir
                    Gregor M'Gregor, who lately landed on the Spanish Main with
                    a small force. General M'Gregor, it seems, left authority with Colonel
                    Eyre to recruit men for his service, and to ship them as he best could.
                    – There are a number of idle gentlemen about Dublin at present,
                    and also many in the country, who have been captivated with the speculation
                    of embarking in the Patriotic cause, and for some time they have
                    appeared in the streets in fanciful uniforms. We understand that
                    Col. Eyre has formed a Committee, who treat with such young gentlemen
                    as have the inclination to proceed on the enterprise, and have money to pay
                    for such rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gregor.
                    The money thus furnished is made a stock purse to pay the freight of the
                    vessel, and hence it is necessary that the greater part of the adventurers should be officers ; for those who
                    are contented with the humble station of privates are not
                    required to contribute and their passage, subsistence, &amp;c. must be
                    defrayed by the common fund. Mr D'Evereaux, from the county
                    of Wexford, is also raising men for the same service, but under
                    different circumstances. He professes to have authority from General Bolivar to grant commissions, and to ship the men he may raise for
                    head-quarters in Venezuela. Mr D'Evereaux has not yet dispatched any men,
                    and Col. Eyre has certainly shewn more activity in this respect.

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Advices have been received again from the Cape of Good Hope of 6th March,
                    which are several days later than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of
                    the Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does not appear that
                    Government have as yet received official information regarding
                    it. The private accounts state that two valuable officers had lost their
                    lives, and also a great number of men. The Governor himself in order
                    by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caffres, had, with a
                    competent force, proceeded to the interior. Great inconvenience
                    was experienced for the want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not
                    this been the case, it was believed that in a very few days
                    tranquility would have been restored.</p>
         <p>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has taken place in
                    the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 25th January, and has done great
                    mischief to the shipping, and also to the plantations of that
                    ill-fated Island.</p>
         <p>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th inst. At Batavia, two of
                    the leaders of the late disturbances have been tried and
                    execute, and that degree of tranquility which terror produces has been
                    restored. In the administration of their colonies in the east, the
                    conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and oppressive ;
                    and it is to be regretted that the extensive and fertile island of Java
                    should have been surrendered to their rapacity. During the short time that
                    it was in possession of this country, various important improvements were introduced into its domestic administration ;
                    the practise of torture, according to the humane and enlightened
                    maxims of British jurisprudence, was abolished ; new and better
                    modes of collecting the revenue were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and
                    of regard for the interests of all the various classes of which the
                    population is composed, was evinced, which made the British Government
                    highly popular.</p>
         <p>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants for the safety of the
                    Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March,
                    and had a great quantity of specie on board. No things have since been
                    received of her. Several vessels sailed since her departure, and have
                    arrived safe. The Ocean quitted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and
                    arrived here several days since.</p>
         <p>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thursday from Jamaica,
                    bring Port Royal Papers to the 25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived
                    at Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regiment
                    was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be disbanded.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>The increased population of this country, as well as the great difficult to
                    which the middling classes of society are exposed in their efforts to procure the ordinary means of sustenance, has given rise to the formation of little copartnerships, or joint
                    stock companies of individuals, who, being unable to command
                        capital enough singly, to encounter the expences of a
                    new settlement, have put their little funds together, with a
                    determination to sail for America, and there jointly to labour for the
                    general good of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour their
                    efforts as to enable them to become independent of each other.
                    By this means much less than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birkbeck as the proper stock for an emigrant to begin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new impetus will be
                    given to that tide of huma beings which is constantly flowing towards the
                    new world. Would it not be policy to give encouragement to
                    these industrious swarms to settle in our own colonies? We have heard with
                    some pleasure in rumour that several parishes have taken into their
                    serious consideration the prudence of establishing a fund for
                    the encouragement of those poor persons who may be dispoed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; in furtherance
                    of which laudable design, an application is to be made to
                    Government for grants of land in desirable siutations, especially in Upper Canada, where the climate is described to be of the
                    finest description. There is no doubt that many who are now pining in
                    workhouses would gladly accept of such an alternative, and who,
                    instead of being, as at present, a burthen to themselves
                    and to society, would, by their exertions, be adding to the importance and
                    stability of our possessions in that quarter, as well as opening a new source for the consumption of our manufactures.</p>

         <p>Letter from Mr Morris Birkbeck</p>
         <p>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818.</p>
         <p>"Sir – Your favour of 15th June is before me.
                    Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I proceed to answer then
                    in order: – Respecting domestic servants ; what may be the condition
                    of our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, but should it
                    be in your power to bring with you female domestics, it would be well to do
                    so ; also a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with families,
                    so much the better. Written engagements for a term, or
                    indentures, are not binding, unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I
                    have not seen any of these documents, and can therefore give you no
                    precise directions for them : perhaps a simple engagement from the parties,
                    acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred in bringing our, might be
                    a sufficient security, leaving their wages to be determined here according to the current rates, yet to be established by the proportion of supply to the demand, which, as I remarked above,
                    it is now impossible to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or
                    female domestics, you would need perhaps six of the former and two of
                    the latter would a safe adventure, looking to the colony for an addition, should you need it, after you are settled – before that you will find a greater number an
                    incumbrance : this is, I think, all I can say to your first, third, fourth,
                    and fifth queries. All expence of transfer of your family
                    and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh ten thousand pounds, I should
                    estimate under L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower
                    would give you most particular information – The luggage would
                    cost about ten dollars per 100 lbs. So much for your query. To the seventh query – I think L.200 would assist your family
                    in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages and clothing. Eighth query
                    – L.3000 would be a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I
                    question your wishing to hold in cultivation a larger tract. Ninth
                    query – I consider our situation not liable to future
                    disturbance from Indians, in the event of a war between Great
                        Britain and the United States, being covered by increasing settlements to the west, north-west, and north.
                    Tenth query – The earthquakes mentioned by Bradbury I
                    have heard of from many persons ; but I have not discovered that it has
                    left any impression on the public mind ; on this score, for my own
                    part, I feel no anxiety about the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in
                        proportion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earthquakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Orleans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that by the
                    eastern cities. When due precaution against the diseases of the climate are
                    observed, I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth query –
                    The health of my family has not suffered from the climate. One of my sons
                    has been affected with ague. This summer has been more sickly in these
                    parts than any season for seven years past, and has afforded me a most
                        encouraging confirmation of the temperature and
                    salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded immeasurable proofs
                    of those facts regarding the sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so
                    anxiously invited the attention of the readers of my journal. On the
                    whole, provided common sense should be seconded by common industry, in
                    the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I think we shall not be
                    visisted by more than our due share of physical calamity. I deferred noticing your second query, the subject being connected with the proposal respecting land, at the conclusion of your
                    letter. I would strongly recommend your deferring the purchase
                    of land until your arrival. It would be difficult to convey
                    to you the reasons, but you would feel the propriety of my advice, should
                    you come. I think you would have as good a choice two years hence as
                    now, because excellent siutations, as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale.
                    I have no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. You inquire
                    concerning venomous reptiles ; they are no source of injury or alarm to us.
                    Insects, in new countries, often abound to an astonishing degree, and
                    are sufficiently teazing to man and beast. Many species yield instantly to
                        cultivation, and are heard of no more as plagues ;
                    others will continue until conquered by order and industry. The
                    thermometer ranges from 13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of
                    course, of rare occurence, and short duration. At Philadelphia, I
                    understand, it rose this summer 97, and in this neighbourhood,
                    in the low river bottoms, I believe it might reach that degree. On our praire I think it never reached 89. The smaller streams are
                    rapid and soon dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – catfish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others I believe. I
                    think 1000 dollars would build a comfortable plain dwelling. – Your
                    obedient servant, M. Birkbeck."</p>

         <p>Intended Colony at the Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>The following letters explains, in detail, the degree of
                    co-operation which Government proposes to afford to those persons who may
                    wish to emigrate from this country. It will be read with
                    peculiar interest, and it enables us to answer, in the most
                    satisfactory manner, the many inquiries which have been addressed to us,
                    upon the nature and extent of the plan of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer submitted an outline to Parliament
                    just before its prorogation.</p>
         <p>(Official Circular)</p>
         <p>"Downing Street, London, 1819. I have to acquaint you in reply to your
                    letter of the –, that the following are the conditions under which
                    it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the Cape of Good
                    Hope.</p>
         <p>The sufferings to which many individuals have been exposed, who
                    have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign possessions, unconnected
                    and unprovided with any capiral, or even the means of support, having been
                    very afflicting to themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to
                    which they have proceeded, the Government have determined
                    to confine the application of the money recently voted by address in the
                    House of Commons, to those persons, who possessing the means,
                    will engage to carry out, at the least, ten able bodied individuals above
                    18 years of age, with or without families, the Government always reserving
                    to itself the right of selecting from the several offers made to them
                    those which may prove, upon examination, to be most eligible.</p>
         <p>In order to give some security to the Government, that the persons
                    undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing so, every
                    person engaging to take out the above mentioned number of persons or
                    families shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every famly so taken out, provided
                    that the family does not consist of more than one man, one woman, and
                    two children under 14 years of age. All children above the number of two
                    will have to be paid for, in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in
                    the proportion of L.5 for every two children under 14 years of
                    age and L.5 for every person between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
         <p>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be provided at
                    the expence of Government for the settlers, who shall also be victualled
                    from the time of their embarkation until the time of their
                    landing in the colony.</p>
         <p>A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter specified, be
                    made to him at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family whom
                    he shall so take our ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the
                    outset shall be repaid on landing, when the victualling at the expence</p>
         <p>of Government shall cease. A further proportion of one third
                    shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the Governor of the
                    colony that the settlers under the direction of the person
                    taking them out are actually located upon the land assigned to them ; and
                    the remainer at the expiration of three months from the date of their location.</p>
         <p>If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of population shall unite
                    in selecting an intelligent individual to proceed to the Cape,
                    with settlers under his direction, not less in number and of the
                    description above mentioned, and shall advance money in the
                    proportion above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such an
                    individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a family,
                    leaving the parish at liverty to make such conditions with the individual,
                    or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again
                    chargeable with the maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their
                    return to this country.</p>
         <p>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it shall be clear that
                    the persons proposin to become settlers shall have distinctly given their
                    consent, and the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of
                    work.</p>
         <p>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one hundred families
                    proceed together, and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of
                    their own persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually located,
                        assign a salary to the minister who they have may have
                    selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by the Secretary
                    of State.</p>
         <p>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, which rent, however,
                    will be remitted for the first ten years ; and at the expiration of three
                    years (during which the party and a number of families, in the proportion
                    of one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), the land
                    shall be measured at the expence of Government, and the holder shall
                    obtain, without fee, his title thereto, on a perpetual quit rent, not
                    exceeding in any case L. 2 sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however
                    to this clause beyond the usual reservations"–that the land shall
                    become foreited to Government, in case the party shall abandon the
                    estate, or not bring it into cultivation within a given number of years. I
                    am Your most obedient humble servant. * The usual reservations are the
                    right of the Crown to mines of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to
                    make such roads as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that the Governor of the
                    Ionian Islands, General Maitland, embarked on the 8th inst. for
                    Rome, in order to negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy
                    of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guildford,
                    who had been charged with the affair by the Prince Regent, had failed in
                    his negotiation to that effect.</p>
         <p>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a deputation from
                    the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon him, to claim the sum to be paid by
                    Ali Pacha, for property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. General Maitland assured them he would not depart without adopting measures in their favour, and immediately issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of
                    payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High Commissioner, ad interim, during the absence of the Governor.</p>
         <p>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. The following is from the
                    Guiana Chronicle of the 24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent:
                    papers, which we have just received, that the Royal York Rangers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had embarked on
                    board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports for Canada, where the regiment is
                    intended to be disbanded. It is stated that each of the men will
                    have a certain portion of land allotted them in that province for
                    cultivation and their future support.</p>
         <p>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d ult by which we learn that
                    in the Court of Session, on the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San
                        Domingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l.
                    each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and above the
                    number allowed by act of Parliament; and a further sum of 10l. for not
                    having the regulations respecting passengers posted up in some
                    conspicuous part of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l.</p>
         <p>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of the 12th June, relative to
                    Mr Gourlay, the celebrated reformer:</p>
         <p>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, we find the far famed champion
                    of civil liberty, Mr Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to
                    the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This production is
                    of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, abounding with strong and
                    vigorous assertions in place of facts–a well wove sophistry to
                    beguile the superficial reader ; and some of the most egregious
                    errors in colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well
                    calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dissent
                    from the political proceeding of this reformer, it would be deemed
                    intrusive by many of our readers to enter into a refutation of the tenets,
                    or an exposure of the absurdities, contained in his address. By others
                    we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. Both
                    imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men we regret that the mad
                    career pursued by Mr Gourlay has deprived society of the benefits which
                    might have been reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless
                    has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy that his career
                    has been checked without any bad consequences to society.</p>
         <p>The following is the present distribution of the forces in the
                    West Indies:– 2d Regiment (or Queen's) –Demerara. 4th
                    Ditto–Head-quarters, Grenada, five companies; Trinidad, three
                    companies ; and Tobago, two companies. 5th
                    Ditto–Head-quarters, Antigua, five companies ; St. Christopher's,
                    four companies ; Montserrat, one company. 9th
                    Ditto–Head-quarters, St Vincent's, five companies ;
                    Dominica, three companies ; St Lucia, two companies. 21st
                    Ditto (Fusileers)–Barbadoes. 1st West India
                    Regiment–Head-quarters, Barbadoes, six companies ; St
                    Lucia, one company ; Dominica, two companies ; Antigua, one
                    company. 3rd Ditto–Head-quarters, Trinidad, five companies till
                    further orders. In Jamaica are the 50th, 58th, 61st, and 92d regiment. In Honduras, five companies of the 2d West India
                    regiment.</p>

         <p>Intended Colony at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
         <p>The following letter explains, in detail, the degree of co-operation which
                    Government proposes to afford to those persons who may wish to emigrate
                    from this country.</p>
         <p>(Official Circular.)</p>
         <p>"Downing-street. London, 1819. "The sufferings to which many individuals
                    have been exposed, who have emigrated to his Majesty's foreign
                    possessions, unconnected, and unprovided with any capital, or even the
                    means of support, having been very afflicting to themselves, and equally
                    burdensome to the colonies to which they have proceeded, the Government have determined to confine the application of the
                    money recently voted by Address in the House of Commons, to those persons
                    who, possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at the least, ten
                        able bodied individuals above 18 years of age, with or
                        without families, the Government always reserving to itself the right of selecting, from the several offers made
                    to them, those which may prove, upon examination, to be most
                    eligible.</p>
         <p>"In order to give some security to the Government, that the persons
                    undertaking to make these establishments have the means of doing
                    so, every person engaging to take out the above-mentioned number
                    of persons or families, shall deposit, at the rate of 10l. (to
                    be repaid as hereinafter mentioned) for every family so taken out,
                    provided that the family does not consist of more than one man, one woman,
                    and two children under 14 years of age. All children ahove the
                    number of two must be paid for, in addition to the deposit
                    above-mentioned, in the proportion of 5l. for every person
                    between the ages of 14 and 18.</p>
         <p>"In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be provided at the
                    expence of Government for the settlers, who shall be victualled from the
                    time of their embarkation until the time of their landing in the
                    Colony.</p>
         <p>"A grant of land, under the conditions hereafter specified, shall
                    be made to him, at the rate of 100 acres for every such person or family
                    whom he so takes out ; one-third of the sum advanced to Government on the
                    outset, shall be repaid on landing, when the victualling at
                    the expense of the Government shall cease. A further proportion
                    of one-third shall be repaid, as soon as it shall be certified to the
                    Governor of the Colony that the settlers, under the direction of the person
                    taking them out, are actually located upon the lands assigned to them
                    ; and the remainder at the expiration of three months from the date of
                    their location.</p>
         <p>"If any parishes in which there may be a redundancy of
                    population, shall unite in selecting an intelligent individual
                    to proceed to the Cape, with settlers under his direction, not less in
                    number and of the description above-mentioned, and shall advance
                    money in the proportion above-mentioned, the Government will grant
                    land to such an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a
                    family, leaving the parish at liberty to make such conditions with the
                    individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the maintenance of such
                    settlers, in the event of their return to this country.</p>
         <p>"But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it shall be clear that
                    the persons proposing to become settlers shall have distinctly given their
                    consent, and that the head of each family is not infirm or incapable of
                    work.</p>
         <p>"It is further proposed, that in any case in which one hundred families
                    proceed together, and apply for leave to carry out with them a minister of
                    their own persuasion, Government will, upon their being actually
                    located, assign a salary to the minister whom they may have selected
                    to accompany them, if he shall be approved by the Secretary of
                    State.</p>
         <p>"The lands will be granted at a quit rent, to be fixed, which
                    rent, however, will be remitted for the first 10 years ; and at the
                    expiration of three years (during which the party, and a number of
                    families, in the proportion of 1 for every 100 acres, must have
                    resided on the estate) the land shall be measured at the expense of
                    Government and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, on
                    a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding[?] in any case of 2l.
                    sterling for every 100 acres subject, however to this clause[?] beyond the
                    usual reservations*–that the land shall become forfeited
                    to Government, in case the party shall abandone the estate,
                    or not bring it into the cultivator within a given number of years. I am,
                    "Your most obedient servant."</p>
         <p>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines of precious
                    stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads as may be necessary for
                    the convenience of the Colony.</p>
         <p>There are already three extensive settlements on the South East Coast of
                    Africa, where the finest wheat is produced, with little labour, namely
                    Algoa Bay, St. Catherine's Bay, and the new settlement on the Knysua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large
                    vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive and fertile lands
                    towards Saldanha Bay. As the produce from the new colonists will
                    consist of grain and as the markets of the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of
                    France, Brazils &amp;c. will in all probability be soon overstocked,
                    the settlers will look to the mother country for a market, when
                    an unfavourable harvest renders the import necessary ; and in anticipation
                    of this event, the merchants interested in the Cape trade intend, we
                    understand, to make an application to Government respecting the Corn
                    Laws, to put the corn from the Cape of Good Hope on the same footing as
                    grain from the British North American colonies.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of Good Hope are to the 17th
                    April, which are considerably later than those previously
                    received.</p>
         <p>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a detachment of troops, joined
                    by a number of the inhabitants, who had been sent to suppress
                    the Caffres, had succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to
                    cross the river. The corn districts were in a great measure cleared of
                    the savages, and the country-people were returning to their homes, where
                    they considered themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for
                    some time to come.</p>
         <p>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from New South Walves, up to
                    the end of November. The colony was then all well, and several
                    convict-ships (the Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,
                    and others) had arrived, having made the passage out direct in
                    the short period of three months and twenty days, and landed all their
                    convicts and passengers in good health. This may be considered as another,
                    among many proofs, that it is unnecessary to make any stay at any
                    intermediate port.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Sierra Leone, datedJanuary 9</p>
         <p>"It is with the deepest regret I inform you, that notwithstanding the
                    liberality of Great Britain, and the faith of treaties solemnly entered
                    into, this coast swarms with slave vessels, drugging thousands of its
                    miserable inhabitants into endless captivity. A few days ago arrived
                    here the Union, of Liverpool : the supercargo states, that during his stay
                    in the River Calaba, not less than eight vessels, averaging 500 slaves
                    each, had sailed for the Spanish Collective."</p>
         <p>" Montreal, May 11</p>
         <p>"We learn there are about 70 souls, mostly Canadians, preparing
                    to set out from this place, the 25th inst. for Lord Selkirk's settlement on
                    the River Rouge. The number of settlers there at this time, it is said
                    amount to about 590. An intelligent Canadian, in easy circumstances
                    with whom we conversed, and who goes thither with the before-mentioned
                    settlers, with all his family, says he passed a winter there when engaged in this for trade and reports it to be a fertile
                    country, and the climate much milder than that of Canada.
                    Thus, there is every appearance, that this Colony, in the course
                    of time, will become populous and flourishing."</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Fire at Newfoundland</p>
         <p>We are sorry to state that another most distressing and calamitous fire has
                    taken place at St. John's Newfoundland. Captain Critchelly, of
                    the alliance, arriv-[?] ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland,
                    [?] which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke out in an
                    uninhabited house in St. John's between one and two o'clock in the morning
                    of the 18th of June and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?]
                    and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such rapidity,
                    that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] milies were burnt out,
                    besides an immense quantity of produce consumed in various stores and
                        warehouses.</p>
         <p>We learn from another account, that the fire destroyed the whole
                    of the old part of the town. It broke out near Conder and Tracy's store,
                    and burnt all between that and Messrs Baine, Johnson and Co.'s.</p>
         <p>Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>At the present moment, under the prospect of emigration, all
                    intelligence coming from this quarter is of peculiar interest. The letters
                    which reached town [?] Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?]
                    tilities anew, and that their numbers were very considerable.</p>
         <p>Cape Town, May 5. The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war
                    is carried on at present on the borders. It is said that the savages
                    are to the amount of 50,000, and a detachment of 6000 attacked
                    Graham's Town on Saturday week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but
                    were repulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried
                    off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every district of the
                    colony for the young boors to inrol themselves to oppose the
                    enemy.</p>
         <p>Cape Town, May 16. The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wilshire have come up with the main body of Caffres, near
                    Graham's Town and have defeated them with great loss. Since then they have
                    withdrawn from the British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?]
                    place a few days ago from England and have since[?] marched off for
                    the frontiers. A large number of infantry have been mounted on
                    horseback to [?] them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are
                    all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present Governor is
                    going home, and that another has been appointed.</p>
         <p>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, which confirms the sad
                    accounts of the miserable fate of the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor.
                    It appears that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from San
                    Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight from Porto Bello,
                    proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th
                    of May, and left on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the effects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had been
                    betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] Porto Bello ; but added he
                    would soon receive reinforcements from England, when he would
                    retake it.</p>
         <p>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South American station,
                    last from Rio Janeiro, whence she sailed on the 8th of June. She landed
                    about two millions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and
                    brought to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, and the
                    Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] treasure on board, passed Lord
                    Cochrane's squadron, in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover
                    even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the ships. His
                    Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent order ; and it is but justice to
                    his Lordship to state, that he has not resorted to any undue or improper
                    means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every instance of
                    complaint made to him by the masters of merchant shipping, of
                    any of their crew having deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again
                        instantly sent on board their respective ships.</p>

         <p>Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope. (From
                        Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.)</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to Parliament the expediency
                    of voting t50,000 towards the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of
                    Good Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is not because
                    that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but that the mother country is too
                    full, that this plan is suggested. The question is not how you
                    maintain a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, but,
                    whether you will stop emigration to the frozen shores of Canada, and to the
                    United States, or divert and encourage it to the finest colony in the world
                    – We surely have learnt enough of North America to convince us
                    of the degraded and miserable conditions of its people. South African, on
                    the other hand, has every advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the
                    land of our forefathers.</p>
         <p>The more fully to understand and appreciate these advantages, we shall set
                    before our readers a short view of the conditions and facilities of the
                    colony in question.</p>
         <p>The spring, from September to December, is the most agreedable season. The
                    summer, from December to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from
                    March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The winter is rainy and
                    stormy, and for the most part so cold as to make fires very comfortable
                    during the months of July, August, and September. Most of the diseases
                    that appear among the natives proceed rather from their gross and indolent
                    modes of living, than the unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of
                    water in summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want of
                    industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as it is in India, by
                    artificial tanks or reservoirs. Whenever, however, irrigation
                    can be employed, either from wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation
                    ensues. Good and abundant water has always been found by digging wells
                    in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the whole colony there is scarcely a
                    river that can be called navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the
                    winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All the rivers are well
                    stocked with perch, eels and small turtle ; and with a certain distance
                    from the coast they abound with the several fish peculiar to these
                    seas.</p>
         <p>There is general want of wood in South Africa – At the distance,
                    however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay there is a large forest of a many
                    thousand acres. Some of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing
                    size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or 40 feet of
                    trunk clear of branches. The wood is useful for many purposes,
                    but will not bear exposure to weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3
                    feet in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – The
                    Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree...</p>
         <p>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, and to what perfection the
                    other wines of the colony are capable of being brought, may very fairly be
                        augured for the great improvement that has already taken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch farmer
                    and the merchant have regarded more the quantity than the
                    quality of their wine. And when a cargo was once shipped, it
                    mattered little to them, whether sound or sour it reached its
                    destination. Little care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches
                    were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decayed and
                    unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all promiscuously thrown
                    in the wine-press. The mode also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and
                    the want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have all
                    contributed to deteriorate the character and confine the sale of Cape
                    Madeira. These defects have lately been in a great measure remedied. Proper
                    persons have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and every
                    care seems now taken to meet and secure the growing demand in European
                    markets. The trifling duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has
                    been the means of introducing it into many families, which have
                    hitherto used home-made wines. And though the merchants at Madeira have
                    made many remonstrances on this preference, it surely is but equitable that
                        encouragement should be given to the stape export of a
                    colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, English. But in addition to wines there are other articles of colonial
                    growth, exported to the East Indies, Europe, and America. Grain,
                    wool, bides, and skins, whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap and candles,
                    aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of commerce that might be turned to
                    the best account. – But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will
                        continue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode
                    of administering its government and laws. It has been said, that
                    despotism would be the best of governments were the despot virtuous. This
                    may be ; but contituted as human nature is, we fear that the
                    purest amongst us needs some control. Control, however,
                    there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes and annuls laws
                    at pleasure. He inserts a proclamation in the Cape Gazette, and
                    from that moment hisfiat becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an
                    adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does not extend
                    beyond that of mere advice. Strange to add, the laws at the Cape are at
                    this moment Dutch laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the
                    different governors of the colony. All pleadings are in writing, and
                    were, till laterly, carried on, foribusclausis. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and
                    civil cases was established, over both of which the governor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in Canada, there is a
                    governor and a council. These act as checks upon each other. But at the
                    Cape there is no appeal beyond the governor.</p>
         <p>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we groan so painfully in this
                    country, are comparatively trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a
                    heavy import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.–
                    This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it fall upon those
                    most likely to emigrate under the provisions of the
                    Parliamentary grant.</p>
         <p>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and precautions, than the
                    encouragement bedd out in Mr Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L.
                    10. is to be made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each
                    individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on reaching the Cape,
                    this deposit is to be returned to the settler by the local government. And
                    such is the liberality that has guided the proposed plans, it is
                        moreover stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to
                    emigrate, and their minister with them, not only permission will be
                    granted them so to do, but provision will be made for him. The
                    separation from country and from kindred is thus softened, and
                    it will allay many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that in
                    distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the settler may still listen
                    to the voice and instruction of a pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and
                    affection, have all united to attach him.</p>
         <p>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of English, has
                    already been made upon a limited plan at Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour
                    in South Africa) : and with such success as to give the best encouragement to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from what we
                    have outselves seen of the colony and its great facilities, we have no
                    doubt whatever of the benefits that must arise to the sober, steady
                    exertions of the industrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty
                    and misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but certain we are,
                    that there is no country under heaven, where the poor may find a safer
                    asylum, and where activity, economy and good conduct, will meet
                    with so certain and full a reward.</p>
         <p>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a Scotch regiment) at the
                    Cape, many of the privates were known to save the whole of their pay, and
                    were thus enabled to return to England with a very hand some little
                    fortune. English servants of all descriptions are in great
                    request, and 1.5 sterling a month are no uncommon wages for a tolerable
                    cook. It is nevertheless to beremember, that clothes of all
                    kinds are expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, lest
                    it should injure the trade of this country. Still farmers in the country
                    dress very coarsely and cheaply ; and their wives and daughters, except on
                    Sunday, are humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a climate as
                    the Cape, there is that occasion for multiplicity and warmth of
                    apparel which colder regions require. For three-fourths of the year, the
                    best bed is a hard mattress with a single coverlet.</p>
         <p>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as we think it very intimately
                    connected with the virtue and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the
                        education of their children. Nothing is more neglected than
                    this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are ignorant to a degree
                    passing credence. With the minister that is to accompany 100
                    families, it would be highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men
                    as schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to introduce into the colony the Madras system of instruction, and
                    a free school upon that plan has been established at Cape Town,
                    with considerable success. Still the natives are stubbornly averse to
                    instruction. Their luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all
                    the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they have neither wish
                    nor ambition. But if knowledge has its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The
                    savage and unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been exercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants by
                    these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want of education, as a main
                    cause. The unjust limits shown by the Dutch laws to the white man's barbarities have doubtless encouraged
                    their perpetration – Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen,
                    and, therefore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the families of the new settlers against the contagion of the
                    inhumanities that they must see practised around them, and how far an
                    early and thorough acquaintance with our duty to God and man will
                    counteract this influence aided a knowledge of common school attainments,
                    we need not say. The</p>
         <p>We have thrown these remarks together more as loose hints for the
                    consideration of our readers, than with any idea of furnishing a complete
                    view of so wide and important a subject. We may be induced hereafter to review the question more in detail. The plan
                    itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, has at
                    present assumed a very imperfect shape. Americe we have not
                    seen, and can only speak from the reports of other. Those reports are
                    sufficiently discouraging. On the contrary, all who have seen
                    and described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food is cheap and
                    abundant, the price of labour is exceedingly high, trade is
                    important and increasing, many parts of the colony are beautiful, and its
                    climate is mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth where
                    so many components of happiness will be found to concentrate.</p>

         <p>Emigration to the Cape of Good Hope.(Official Circular.)</p>
         <p>The following circular has been addressed to the parties whose lists of the
                    individuals engaged to proceed with them as settlers to the Cape of
                    Good Hope have been approved of by the Colonial Department:
                    –</p>
         <p>Downing Street, London, 30th Sept. 1819.</p>
         <p>Sir – I am directed by Earl Batburst to acquaint you, that he has
                    under consideration your letter of, and that he accepts the proposal which
                    you have mde, to take a party of able bodied settlers, with their families,
                    to the Cape of Good Hope, where a grant of land will accordingly be assigned to you on your arrival, in conformity with the regulations laid down by his Majesty's Government.</p>
         <p>I have therefore to request, that you will immediately transmit to me three
                    separate lists of the individuals who have placed themselves under your
                    direction, and I inclose to you proper returns for that purpose ; at the
                    same time, I deem it necessary to mention, that it is absolutely requisite
                    that the details respecting the individuals of your party which you are
                    called upon to state in your returns should be correctly specified, as any erroneous statement upon these heads, but more
                    particularly in respect of the age of the individuals, could not fail
                    to be productive of much inconvenience. Upon receiving there returns, I
                    shall lose no time in stating to you the amount of the money which you will
                    be required to deposit under the existing regulations, and the mode in
                    which the payment is to be made.</p>
         <p>I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,</p>
         <p>(Signed)Henry Goulburn.</p>
         <p>P.S. – If there be any Officers on the half pay of the army or navy,
                    or military of naval pensioners among the individuals proceeding under your
                    direction, it will be necessary that you should transmit to me a (fourth)
                    list, specifying their usual place of residence, and the designation under
                    which they are respectively known at the War Office, and at the Admiralty,
                    in order that I may take the necessary measures to enable them to
                    receive their allowances in the colony.</p>

                    War, and to the Secretary of the Admiralty, stating their intention to
                    emigrate to the Cape of Good Hope, and requesting instructions for their
                    guidance in respect to the receipt of their allowances.</p>
         <p>In making your arrangements for embarkation, it will be necessary that you
                    should bear in mind, that you will be allowed tonnage for the
                    conveyance of the baggage of your party, at the rate of one ton

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Letters and papers have been received from Jamaica to the 5 ult. We are
                    sorry to observe, that the letlets from thence state that the
                    island was very unhealthy. The deaths from the fever were[?]
                    very[?] considerable, and were increasing. The garrison had been particularly unhealthy.</p>
         <p>The [?]th and 92d regiments have suffered severely by the [?] of the climate
                    and are reduced to mere skeletons. We [?] [?] the [?] of several
                    officers [?] [?] [?] to it ; causing them [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]
                    [?] several others.</p>
         <p>A serious dispute exists between the Governor of [?] [?] [?] a general

         <p>[?] of the [?]. His Lordship has been support-[?] ed by counter
                    meetings of the inhabitants, who complain of the licentiousness
                    of the press of the island.</p>
         <p>(From the Port Royal Gazette of the 28th August)"Private letters from Panama state, that Lord Cochran had
                    taken Petit Callao[?], in which port a vessel was at anchor, having on
                    board 100,000 dollars. It was further said that his Lordship has passed
                    Guayaquil oh his way to Chili. Almost a forthnight ago, intelligence reached the Governor of Carthagena, from Santa Fe,
                    that General Bolivar, who had been joined by one of Murillo's Generals,
                    with a number of troops, was making rapid advances towards Santa Fe with
                    upwards of 5000 men ; and it was expected the next courier would
                    announce[?] the fall of that place. An Aide-de Camp of the
                    Governor of that place arrived at Carthagena at midnight with
                    the above information. Another account states, that the
                    Venezuelian army, under General Bolivar in person, had obtained
                        possession of Santa Fe, and that his advanced guard was at
                    Honda[?] ; he had succeeded in cutting off the retreat of General
                    Samana[?], the Captain-General of Santa Fe ; his Secretary, Ramirez, has
                    arrived at Carthagena with the above intelligence ; it was also added that
                    a part of Bolivar's army would soon be in Mempaz[?].</p>
         <p>There have arrived at the port of Quebec, this present season
                    9,513 settlers.</p>
         <p>A letter from Demerara of the 14th August says that a severe shock of an
                    earthquake had been felt in that colony for the first time since the memory
                    of man[?]. It occurred on the 12th. and continued for 30 second[?].</p>
         <p>"Madras, April 14. "The gratifying intelligence of the fall of Asserghur reached the Presidency yesterday. We wait with
                    impatience for the official details.</p>
         <p>"Madras, April 17. It is with since regret that we announce the death
                    of John Duncan, Esq. third Member of the Medical Board at this
                    Presidency, at General Lang's gardens. On Saturday last, the 10th instant.
                    The funeral took place on Sunday evening, with the honours due to his
                    rank ; and is remains were attended to the place of internment by a
                    numerous assemblage of his friends at the Presidency. Mr Duncan's valuable
                    services were for mroe than 30 years devoted to the benefit of the
                    public, and the relief of suffering humanity[?] ; and during the whole of that period, it may be truly said, that he always
                    evinced a firm, humane[?], and honourable disposition, the
                    remembrance of which must render his memory universally respected.</p>
         <p>"Calcutta, March 24. "A Treaty has been concluded by the Hon. Sir
                    Stamford Raffles[?], on the part of the Most Noble the
                    Governor-General, with the Sultan of Jahore and Tomangong
                    of Sincapore, establishing a British Residency at the latter
                    place, under Major Furqubar, with a settlement on the ruins of the ancient
                    captial of that country, over which, we may congratulate our readers,
                    that the British flag is now flying ; Sir S. Raffles having
                    returned from this expedition to Penang[?] on the 4th of last month. The
                    grant of this island, which is situated at the southern extremity of the
                    Peninsula of Malacca[?] must become valuable to the British Government, especially when accompanied, as we understand that it
                    is, with the privilege of establishing further settlements along
                    the extensive coast of Jahore, which must afford considerable protection to
                    our commerce in that quarter, particularly to ships passing through
                    the Straits, and enable us to watch the proceedings of our Bataxian
                    competitors.</p>
         <p>Cape Town Gazettes to the 1st of August have come to
                    our hands. At the present moment, when plans for colonising the territory
                    adjoining the Cape of Good Hope, occupy so much attention, we turn to these
                        papers with peculiar anxiety. They, however, contain
                    little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing whatever is
                    said of the incursions of the Caffres. We collect incidentally, that the
                    scarcity which lately prevailed at the Cape has entirely ceased
                    ; ample supplies of wheat and flour having lately been imported or
                    brought to market.</p>
         <p>Maritime Intelligence</p>
         <p>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the Queen Charlotte, in
                    Portsmouth harbour, and continued by adjournment during
                    Saturday, to inquire into the circumstances of the supposed concealment of
                    two deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot on board his
                    Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. Dillon, in the month of October
                    last, when that ship was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try
                    Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said ship, for his
                    conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] was crowded with officers, &amp;c.
                    from the shore each day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday afternnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Monday, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The Court having
                    considered the whole of the evidence, were of opinion that the charge was
                    proved, and sentenced him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and
                    severely reprimanded.</p>
         <p>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated March 30th, were
                    receivedon Sunday. The ships Surrey and Lord Sidmouth, with
                    convicts from England, arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of
                    80 tons burden, intended for the Chief of the Society Islands, was to
                    be launched on the 7th of April. The Shipley, with dispatches and troops on
                    board, was to sail on the first, and may, therefore, be expected daily
                    in this country.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Spanish Town, Jamaica–August 31.</p>
         <p>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting news of the voyages
                    which the fever is committing amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have
                    made their escape on board the Serapis 64, which has been roofed to,
                    and most handsomely and humanely given up by the Admiral for the use of the
                    troops. The loss in men stands about thus: 59th[?], 200[?] ; 92d, 120.
                    The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can learn, their
                    loss is not great. The following is a list of the officers and their
                    relatives who have fallen victims in the course of this month :
                    –</p>
         <p>Lieut.-Colonel Sparrow, Deputy Adjt.-General. Lieut.-Colonel [?], 52d
                    regiment. Lieut.-Colonel Hill th[?] regiment. Major Rowe, 50th
                    regiment, son-in-law of Paymaster Montgomery, of the 50th.
                    Mrs Rowe, wife of Major Rowe, whom she survived but a few
                    hours, and daughter of Paymaster Montgomery. Major
                    Montgomery, 50th, son of Paymaster Montgomery. Mrs
                    Montgomery, wife of ditto. Assistant Surgeon Brown, 50th, son in-law of do.
                    Lieut. Richardson, 50th. Lieut. North[?], 50th. Lieut. and
                    Adjutant Lyon, 50th. Two Misses Lyon, daughter of Adjutant Lyon.
                    Lieuts. R. M'Donald and George Mackie, 92d. Ensign [?] [?]th
                    Doctor [?], Medical Staff. Captain and Paymaster Turner, 58th.
                    The Misses Baxter, daughters of Quarter-Master Baxter[?].</p>
         <p>The scenes that have occurred during this awful mortality have been most
                    distressing. It has not been confined to the military, for the inhabitants
                    have even out numbered them.</p>
         <p>The Quebec Mercury of the [?] gives long extracts
                    from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a large tract of
                    country by the [?] Indians, to the British Government, 2,748,000 acres,
                    stretching from the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower
                    part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements on the
                    Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into contact with or approach within
                    many miles of the boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition
                    that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian territory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives against this
                    country.</p>
         <p>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated the 28th September, which
                    mention, that the plague which had been for some time in the vicinity, had
                    at length broken out in that town. We are happy to add however, that
                    the deaths at that period were only three or four each day, and it was then
                    confined to the Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen
                    victims to the pestilence. The weather being extremely
                    cold, great hopes were entertained that the further progress of the disease
                    would speedily be put a stop to when trade, which then at a stand, would
                    renew its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Mogadoru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the greater part of whom
                    consider it contrary to their religious tenets to use any
                    caution to prevent their taking the infection ; and, in the event of their
                    having it would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any means
                    to counteract it.</p>

         <p>Emigration to America</p>
         <p>[ From the Observer. ]</p>
         <p>The following letter from a lady who emigrated to America, from
                    within four miles of Godalming, in Surrey, two years back, has
                    been handed to us for insertion. During the present rage
                    for emigration, we think we are justified in giving it
                    insertion, leaving it to those who are interested in its
                    contents to draw their own con clusions. We have reason to conclude that
                    the letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many have been which
                    have found their way into the public press, the produce of ingenuity on
                    this side the Atlantic: –</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818</p>
         <p>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, together with the patterns you were kind enough to forward Although our
                    habits here are in many respects different from those on your side of the
                    Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a considerable degree of anxiety among
                    our American belles for English fasions ; and the display which your prompt
                        attention to my request has enabled me to make, has procured
                    me not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask me
                    to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing hither with your
                    wife and family. I can have no hesitation in complying with this request ;
                    but, at the same time, I shrink from the responsibility of your being
                    persuade, from any things which I may say, to follow my example. It is
                    impossible to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise
                    it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating prosperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, as far as
                    my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I am persuaded that many of
                    those failures have been the result of unpardonable imprudence, and the
                    absence of that activity and spirit of perseverance, by which persons
                    depending on their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen
                    many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from having
                    left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more money than was
                    sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. This has been
                    dissipated, on their landing, almost before they had recovered the effects
                    of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and being thus reduced to extremity, their
                    spirits have failed, and they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and
                    listless despair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades
                    to follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them call it, of
                    becoming journeymen, do tolerably well.</p>
         <p>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the species of
                    drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order to support a decent
                    appearance in London. You often joked me on my enterprising disposition,
                    and doubted my resolution to come to this country in search of that
                    independence which I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am,
                    however, and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work women, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who take
                    their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this and so will Mrs B.
                    It is, however, no less true than extraordinary. In short I have
                    every reason to be grateful to Providence for having given me the
                    confidence to sufficient to try an experiment which has turned out so
                    fortunately. I have commenced both millinery and dress-making, to which I
                    have added the childbed and ready made linen business ; and in
                    every one of branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes have
                    been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 1.60 Sterling and a
                    few of those articles of stock which were necessary to make a show. These,
                    combined with the attractive titled of " Miss P–, from
                    London,'&amp;c. in a few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did
                    my utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved from a
                    situation of obscurity to one of the first respectability. I am
                    thus particular because I know you feel an interest in my fate. My brother
                    James, who you know is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally
                    fortunate.– He has had several contracts, and is now building a row
                    of twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description.</p>
         <p>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from Godalmbing and its
                    neighbourhood I am proud to say they have all been tolerably successful.
                    The greater part of them, you know, were farmers, and they are now settled
                    in farms of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one
                    thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came out with small
                    capitals–but none with less than myself–and husbanding their
                    resources, and abstaining from extravagance of every description, they
                    finally successed in laying the foundation of their own future
                    happiness.</p>
         <p>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; but this must
                    wear off in the course of time?other there is a roughness and absence of
                    what we call "good manners" about some of the Americans, not at all
                    congenial to English taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable
                    ; and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their humours,
                    are really very kind, and disposed to friendly intercourse. You
                    talk to carrying your family to the Western states–to the Illinois
                    country, and of commencing farmer and storekeeping there. It is probably
                    that your views may be very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to
                    us, if not at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present
                    comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know nothing but by report. The emigration in that direction has been immense,
                    but the journey to some has been so long, as frequently to produce
                    repentance before the destined goal was reached. We have had several
                    English, Scotch, and Irish families here, on the way to
                    Pittsburgh, who, I understand, were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ;
                    but I have not heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the
                    Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birkbeck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter great
                    privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseverance,
                    however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the natural
                    course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty and
                    independence, must be attained ; and this as you very justly say, is "worth
                    a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can be content to give up all those
                    luxuries of which an English fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits
                    of social intercourse to which an English neighbourhood give
                        encouragement ; and to derive happiness from the
                    consciousness of seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the
                    necessaries of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you,
                    that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalanced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, at least
                    you will be free here ; and as for society, your own family, large as it
                    is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to which, in proportion as wealth
                    increases, civilisation must follow. If you could get three or four
                    families with whom you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in
                    your neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happiness would be attained.</p>
         <p>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your landing here,
                    L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and common good fortune,
                    must afford yo uthe means of certain prosperity. I shall, however, write
                    again in September on this subject, when I intend sending for my sister,
                    and perhaps the information I may be able to collect in the
                    interim will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to
                    this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have another
                    cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every particular in my
                    next, as well as send you a list of the things, which it will be policy for
                    you to bring with you. Your seven children, instead of being a burden to
                    you here, will form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth."</p>

         <p>Emigration to Canada.</p>
         <p>About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from Canada, to Paisley, and brings
                    very favourable intelligence from that country. He is a native of
                    Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and is going home again, as he calls
                    it, early in the spring. This person gives the most satisfactory and
                    cheering account of the place, and says his chief complaint was the want of
                    society to share in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and
                    to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of his principal reasons
                    for coming here at present was hearing of our distressed condition, and
                    that he might be able to persuade others to follow his example ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, intelligent, and
                    social neighbours. His arrival and narrations, combined with other
                    circumstances, have been the subject of considerable discussion the
                    whole of last week. A strong desire for emigration has been manifested, and
                    about 300 have already subscribed their names, as a testimony of their
                    ardour to go away. A petition is immediately to be forwarded to
                    his Majesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by way
                    of loan or donation, to enable them to carry their wishes into execution.
                    This petition, it is said, is to be supported by the principal gentlemen of the county, and the utmost anxiety will doubtless
                    prevail concerning its success. – Let us hope that Government will
                    see the necessity of attending to the supplications of these
                    people. The Sheriff Depute has been memorialized upon the
                    subject, to give his counsel and support in behalf of the
                    measure, and it is much to his honour that he has evinced a great
                    disposition to favour the object in view. His office has been
                    appointed for the reception of signatures, where the persons experience the
                    greatest kindness in every possible way. It is proper, at the
                    same time, to mention, that a number who were wishing to subscribe as
                    desirous to emigrate, have been rejected ; as their circumstances were not
                    of that despairing nature as to warrant an interposition of
                    this kind in their favour. It cannot be expected that those who enjoy a
                    considerable degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient means
                    of their own to emigrate without public aid, ought to be included among
                    that number destined to participate in this salutary and
                        benevolent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with
                    their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily employed in
                    jeering and deprecating the idea of emigration and telling the " people to
                    stay and help" in the recovery of their rights. They declare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, intended to be
                    played against them, in order to destroy the unanimity which they say
                    exists in the nation concerning their grand object. These querulous
                    politicians complain of the climate of Canada, and it must be granted that
                    it resembles Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in summer and coller in winter than our own island but the country is healthy,
                    the soil is fruitful and strong constitutions and longevity are as
                    common there as in any other part of the globe. The same manners,
                    language, and regulations prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and
                    when people have plenty of provisions, fuel and warm clothing to
                    resist the effects of heavy snows and intense frosts, the objection of cold
                    is less worthy of consideration. – Glasgow

         <p>Dutch Colonial Law, and Negro Fortitude.</p>
         <p>(From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela, Trinidad, Margaritta, and
                    Tobago, just published.)</p>
         <p>Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties practised on the
                    negroes at Surinam, relates that on his arrival in that colony, a white man
                    was flagged by a black executioner, for having stolen some money from the
                        townhouse ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the
                        punishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro
                    was broken on the wheel for the same crime, and he bore that horrible
                    punishment without a sigh. A moment afterwards, they prepared to
                    hang another, and whilst the hangman was tying the cord round his neck to
                    launch him into eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of contempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the
                    execution. " Having expressed to the persons who were near me, (says
                    Captain Stedman) how much I was shocked with the injustice and
                    cruelty of those executions, and surprised at the intrepidity of the
                    negroes during the punishment, a very decent looking man thus addressed
                    me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you were better
                    acquainted with negro slaves, what you now see would neither excite your
                    surprise nor your pity. It is not long since I saw a negro suspended from
                    that very gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which it
                    was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which was passed an iron
                    hook attached to a chain. He lived three days suspended in that manner, his
                    head and feet hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops
                    of water that fell on it, for it rained at the time. The sufferer did
                    not, however, utter a groan, and never once complained. On the third day,
                    another negro was flogged under the gallows, and having cried from pain,
                    the former reproached him for his want of courage: " Are you a man?"
                    said he to him, " you behave like a child!" – A moment afterwards
                    the soldier who was sentry on the spot taking pity on him, dashed out his
                    brains with the butt end of his musquet. " I saw another negro
                    quartered," the narrator: " After his arms and legs were tied to four very
                    strong horses, an iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and
                    feet He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of ru,,
                    and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. But that which amused
                    us most," continued this monster, "was the humour of the fellow, who, when
                    the hangman presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for,
                    told him to drink first, as he was very much afraid of bepoisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses should not kick
                    him. As for old negroes being broken on the wheel, and young women burnt
                    alive, nothing is more common in this colony!"</p>

      <header>Mr Birkbeck's SettlementA small...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</p>
         <p>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters and
                    extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured a
                    copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counteract the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement by
                    Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first transmitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the
                    notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settlement, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction,
                    were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emigration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them
                    worth reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied
                    them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birkbeck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire
                    of his own endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details
                        regarding the settlement. The Americans are every year
                    pushing forward into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of
                    our countrymen, when withdrawing from a society richly provided
                    with all the accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary
                    to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World and
                    to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea Though the
                    activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes and even luxuries of
                    life to this remote place, still the settlers must find such a difference
                    in their situation as must subject them to go many privations ;
                    and some details, shewing how the colonists got over their difficulties,
                    how their various wants were supplied, and how the feelings and habits of
                    civilized life accommodated themselves to the woods and the wilderness,
                    would have been much more interesting than a reply to Cobbett's captious
                    objections. One of the most trying privations of the colony
                    seems to be a want of wives, an evil which happily does not affect the
                    mother country, amidst all her other sufferings. The evil has probably been
                    aggravated by some of the colonists forgetting to take their
                    wives with them. If matters don't get better in this particular, we may
                    expect to hear of some of the adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine
                    spoliation. A cargo of young ladies would evidently be one of the best
                    mercantile speculations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten
                    or twelve thousand females at the last census, we have no doubt that some
                    of our enterprising export traders will take the hint, and, by
                    scouring the boarding-schools, complete a choice assortment,
                    adapted to the Illinois market.</p>
         <p>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any general
                    interest.</p>
         <p>"English Prairie, July 13. 1819. "My Friends and
                    Countrymen,–For your service I exhibited, in two publications, an
                    outline of the process of emigration, from its commencement up to the final
                    settlement.</p>
         <p>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning on
                    which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient time has
                    elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience, by which they are
                    confirmed in every important particular. I showed you my own tract through
                    the gloomy forest into a delightful country, better prepared for
                    an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy woods by half a century of
                    labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed a road to it;" for it was my
                    ambition to be surrounded by my old friends and neighbours. In this, too, I
                    am gratified ; and we are contented with out allotment, both as
                    to our present state and future prospects.</p>
         <p>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inhabitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred
                    persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new
                    settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ;
                    and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its
                    salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water, and many more are
                    in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but our
                    exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent objects of
                    building and fencing, of which much has already been done. We have,
                    however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and I think acres of corn
                    are now growing than there are individuals in the settlement."</p>
         <p>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing his
                    operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he shall
                    pursue ; but the labourer has made an establishment. It is not with him as with the capitalist, a state
                    of hope merely, from good prospects, but of enjoyment, from good
                    possessions. Numbers of this class, and of mechanics, have already realized
                    their little freeholds, and are building cabins for themselves.
                    The fruits of their labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess,
                    because they have highr objects ; and, considering their former depressed
                        condition, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to
                    them, that they betry no arrogance in their to
                    independence."</p>
         <p>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far as my
                    observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, in my view
                    of the profits of cultivation to early settlers, I have not made sufficient
                    allowance in time for the innumerable delays and disappointments
                    inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. A year of preparatory
                    and unproductive exertion should be added to the debtor-side of the account
                    at the outset."</p>

         <p>Proceedings of the Court</p>
         <p>Lord Provost Manderston having been called to the
                    Chair, the Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results
                    and general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensberry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named
                    a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to
                    the adjourned meeting to be held in February next.</p>
         <p>Mr John Witham junior then rose, and requested leave to
                    submit a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in
                    substance that, though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to
                    the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet
                    anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction
                    that the exertions of the Managers had, at last, placed this valuable
                    Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited
                    the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an
                    interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now
                    stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants,
                    or of recent patients, the answers were uniformly
                    satisfactory. The Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom
                    and the medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various
                    salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous
                    state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court
                    and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospital was in a good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not
                    fall to afford that assistance to the Managers here, and that security
                    against internal abuses, which they had done in so many other similar
                    institutions. It was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed
                    against this species of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in
                    addition, to visitors of our sex, there was a committee of ladies, who
                    visisted the female wards, and from the joint labours of both classes of
                    visitors many and great advantages had resulted. But in this city we had
                    hospitals for females, which are governed by men only, without
                    seeking any help from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified
                    to discharge most of the duties. This view of these matters, he trusted,
                    would yet be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the
                        meeting to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which
                    the city of Edinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the
                    Court, and its Honoured Chairman, that this subject was not
                    introduced with the view of touching upon, or insinuating any thing
                    respecting the city's affairs. The money, he understood, was
                    secured on the ale duty ; but why should the Hospital lose one-half per
                    cent, of interest? He had once made a calculation, according to which the
                    loss, from the beginning, had amounted to about L.10,000. It had
                    been stated that the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to
                    the Hospital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding
                    L.59 of interest that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the
                    subject the present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital
                    of any part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was
                    built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, by
                    the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edinburgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Government, on condition of paying the interest to the
                    Infirmary, which inte-rest, if paid at two terms in the years, should be
                    restricted to 3 1/2 per cent. And as the property tax–which the Town
                    did not retain from the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to
                    Government,–is now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding
                    the usual rate of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several
                        gentlemen as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on
                    interest at 5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to
                    pay that rate of interest.</p>
         <p>Mr Alex. Cruishank seconded the motion</p>
         <p>Col. Crichton regretted that the respectable gentlemen
                    should have introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but
                    when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that when his servants
                    or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received was
                    in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respectable citizen, could command in his own house. But he could mention the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his own
                    – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profession, who lives abroad, and who was recently in this country.
                    That professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the
                    medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter of
                    pride, he said, to every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the
                    Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe.
                    It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and a
                    nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the
                    answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospital treatment is, that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh.
                    Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at the
                    sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Christain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and
                    management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration and
                    without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do he must say,
                    it would be much more creditable to the respectable gentlemen if
                    they should confine themselves to expressing their high opinion
                    of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of occupying
                    the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling about trifles,
                    which were every way contemptible. After a pause, Col. Crichton made a
                    counter motion, to get rid of Mr Wigham's.</p>
         <p>Lord Meadowbank reminded the Court, that this matter of
                        interest had already been under the consideration of a
                    Committee, and decided on by the Court.</p>
         <p>Henry Jardine, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the
                    Town of Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last
                    year.</p>
         <p>Mr Ritchie rose and said, that though perfectly aware
                    of what the result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled
                    without giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure
                    to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doctrines in such meetings as this,–a change from which he
                    anticipated much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject
                    by the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him
                    that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too trifling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional
                    interest of the money in question would obviously extend the means of healingthe sick, the great object of the Institution.
                    Nothing, indeed, which had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord
                    on the other side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that five per cent is the legal rate of interest, and
                    that the Town of Edinburgh ought not to pay less.</p>
         <p>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if Mr W. did
                    not, he would submit a motion, namely, Visitori 'And
                    this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides
                    of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably conducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the
                    measure was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management
                    was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and
                    this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other
                    places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and
                    much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at
                    Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edinburgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed, and in the
                    west of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial
                    here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, and
                    that no measure could be carried here without their consent, the granting
                    of Visitors would be a boon from themselves. He moved,
                    that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act monthly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to
                    them for the consideration of the Managers.</p>
         <p>Mr Wigham seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed
                    averse to entertain it, it was withdrawn.</p>
         <p>Mr Ritchie then said, that as his last motion was
                    intended chiefly as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he
                    would also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion which he
                        wished to submit, but the merits of which he was not then
                    fully prepared to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would
                    not be said, that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble, or
                        unnecessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object
                    was the promotion of medical science, and its nature would be
                    understood by his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports
                    of Dr Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish
                    annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to furnish information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the
                    names of the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support
                    of the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use in marking the
                    progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do positive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be
                    neglected as utterly without value. This, however, is not the case ; and
                    the reports we have of late years received from the Fever
                    Hospitals of Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of
                    every kind and in every place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect
                    this information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from
                    the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads us to
                    suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regular as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will venture to say,
                    that where it has not yet been practised, its good effects upon
                    the institution in an economical as well as professional points of view,
                    will soon be apparent."–His motion went to carry this suggestion
                    into effect ; and without farther preface he should now read it. The
                    substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept at present,
                    Digest of the whole should be kept in a tabular form but
                    especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence
                    of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis, termination and assigned causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the
                    temperatures and moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of
                    staple provisions &amp;c. ; with an annual medical report,
                    taking notice of the increase or decrease of population, and of
                    the employment, diet and habits of the labouring classes, as far
                    as practicable. Some of the members, he observed, seemed to be
                    amused with this enumeration ; but the medical gentlemen would be aware of
                    what he pointed at. With their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish
                    to interfere. They knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and
                    honourably. In their practise they attended to every thing that was
                    necessary ; but their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to
                    preserve the results of their skill and experience.</p>
         <p>The Lord President said he hoped the gentlemen who had
                    made this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time
                        requisite to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it
                    would be in an hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the
                    Managers had no compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time
                    was so occupied with their own private avocations.</p>
         <p>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had fallen from
                    the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he would beg leave to read
                    another passage from Dr Duncan's voluble publication, and which,
                    he hoped, would obviate some of the difficulties adverted to. "
                    The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping such tabular records, is not so
                    great as might be supposed. It requires only system and regularity; and
                    when we see how easily it is done in the military hospital, we cannot help regretting that it is not also in-troduced general into civil hospitals. If the
                    practitioner himself has not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed
                    table, it would be very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the
                    time of that assistant would not easily permit him, the duty would be very gladly takenby another of the Hospital pupils.</p>
         <p>Dr Hope, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the
                    motion. The Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to
                    every proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present, however, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records
                    of the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehension and many talents. It was a task which every one was not
                        qualified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the
                    public, and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not
                    be expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals,
                    where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to
                    their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for
                    making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and
                    that these Journals are open to all the medical
                        attendants; so that whoever finds that he has time and talents for
                    the performance of such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking
                    and completing them. Accordingly we had had the very able
                    reports of Dr Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has
                    now the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to
                    leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents
                    of individuals.</p>
         <p>The Mover then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr.
                    Welsh's judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would
                    never have introduced such a measure, had it not been suggested and
                    recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not undertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or
                    that he could do it better, or even so well as many other members of
                    the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the
                    subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however to
                    give unnecessary trouble, and should, therefore, for the present, beg leave
                    to withdraw his motion.</p>
         <p>Form of Process in the JusticiaryCourt.</p>
         <p>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, with a
                    laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurisprudence,
                    has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court "strikes the Jury, by
                    taking 45 after 45, until they served
                        in rotation." They consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the
                    High Constables" for Edinburgh and those "regularly required from the
                    counties of Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were then put upon a roll, which was put into
                    the bands of the Clerk of Court;"– the Jurors thus struck being
                    cited, not by a Sheriff officer, but by a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We
                    are not aware of any law which requires the Clerk of Court to take the
                    Jurors by rotation ; but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he
                    resorts to this unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a
                    virtue which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate
                    when such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incontrovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society,
                    honour and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when
                    the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it would
                    be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at present from
                    principle, into specific rules for directing the conduct of their
                    successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is about to introduce
                    into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the Judicatories of Scotland ;
                    and his Lordship, it is obvious, might obtain a well-merited popularity by
                    throwing in some clauses to fix the qualifications of a Juror in the
                    different counties of Scotland, and to regulate the times and
                    the manner in which lists of Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl
                    of 45, and then to a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain
                    discretion on more than one of these points left with functionaries, who,
                    we doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be a
                    relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less impartial juries than at present, yet, if the ballot were introduced here,
                    as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would be more
                    coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and misrepresentation. It
                    would be no disgrace to Scotland to borrow in this respect from
                    her sister kingdom, but an honour which France seems willing to do herself
                    at present, and which we very lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury
                    Court.</p>
         <p>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such a manner as to
                    exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal magnetic phenomena mentioned
                    by Captain Flinders, in his voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention
                    to the subject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all
                    probability, will remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the
                        local attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus
                    be of real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of this
                    plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent to the
                    Admiralty.</p>

         <p>Upper Canada</p>
         <p>Extract from " A Visit to the Province of Upper Canada, in 1819," By James Strachan.</p>
         <p>[?] the Stream of Emigration now chiefly to the United States, and not to
                    Canada.</p>
         <p>The greater number are decieved; they know no[?] of this country.
                    Many leave Great Britain from [?] discontents; and such the province is
                    better. [?]. Lately the notes of Mr. Birkbeck have ex[?]
                    much consideration; and all his assertions have [?] believed, without
                    investigation. Though I [?] [?] a bad man (I know him only from his
                    [?] yet he is much to be pitied, for his choice is [?]; and by this
                    time he begins to feel it. [?] Birkbeck, accustomed to all the comforts,
                    and, [?], much of the elegance of life, plunges, [?[ family, into a
                    forest, where they have fre[?] to sleep under the canopy of
                    heaven with a [?]. He is forced to take the axe in his hand, [?] in
                    felling the pines of which he is to make [?], which he builds at a great
                    distance [?] neighbour–opening to a wet plain, in [?] and an
                    impenetrable forest in the rear. This [?] covered with bark–it has
                    no floor but [?] as the surrounding country is flat, there [?], and no
                    boards to be had. Mr Birk[?] date not leave home, for any
                    distance, with[?] guide; and his children cannot go twenty
                    [?] from the house, without being lost. He gets [?] pressing of his
                    wants supplied at an enormous[?] expense. And now, that he is on
                    his land. [?] shall he do; it is covered with trees, or it is [?]
                    unhealthy; and if he hire people to work, [?] of the farm will never pay
                    them: but [?] bae servants, and he is obliged to sit down [?] them,
                    and to become their companion. Mr. Birkbeck[?], who was accustomed to go
                    from one field to another, admiring his crops and his cattle, and
                    thing to do but to give the servants their orders the day, and saw all
                    his works proceeding as ra[?] as he wished, now finds himself an
                    insulated [?], surrounded by a few miserable fiels, taken [?] the bog,
                    and full of musquetoes; his children [?] sick from this unhealthy
                    situation; and, in [?] severe disease, beyond the reach of medical
                    assistance. It is possible to believe that, under such circumstances,
                    he does not regret the country he has [?]. And let me not be told that the
                    prospect of [?]] his children a rich inheritance will turn the [?]
                    into sweet–he is not that sort of man; nor do [?] any law of nature
                    which urges a parent to [?] his own happiness, in order to confer a
                        doubt[?] upon his children. We allow that, after a [?],
                    he will be surrounded with neighbours; [?] their society is not very
                    agreeable; it is indeed [?], as Mr Birkbeck himself admits. After [?]
                    his connexions, his country, all his early [?] and pleasing recollections,
                    his ease and [?] what does he gain? Some landed property, [?] he dies
                    in improving, in an unhealthy situation[?]. He may not be able
                    to leave a farm to each of his children[?]; but of what use will they be if
                    not cultivated[?]? And he will discover in the bitterness of
                    [?], that this legacy is not equal to the placing [?] upon a farm,
                    though taken at a rack-rent. [?] different the situation of a loyal farer,
                        pos[?] of Mr. Birkbeck's substance, if he should [?]
                    this province[?]![?] He need not go ten miles from [?] settlement, even if
                    he went at once up[?] lands granted him by the crown. But, if he
                    [?] an improved farm, his privations will be [?] compared to those
                    which he must suffer in [?] to the back settlements of the United States,
                    as [?] still more fully appear.</p>
         <p>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with [?] possible advantage of
                    soil, neighbourhood, [?] climate, emigration to America, a country so
                    [?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep and [?] consideration. The
                    persons emigrating [?] civil in their property, break up all commerce,
                    [?], and connexions in the country they are leav[?] and if
                    they find their expectations disappoint[?] the country of their
                    choice, they are ashamed, perhaps unable, to return. Emigrants often fail,
                    [?] they have never examined their subjects pro[?] and
                    find, on trial, that they do not possess qualities to insure
                    success.–The habits, knowledge, and accomodation of manners,
                    [?] this new life requires, are not, perhaps, na[?] to
                    them–they have not the strength, the [?] and perseverance, which
                    their new situation [?]. The emigrant is not prepared to meet the
                    difficulties[?] which the climate, new manner of living, [?] or
                    vermin, may bring upon him; and which, [?] of all his exertions, may
                    frequently destroy [?]. It is, therefore, the greatest cruelty to [?]
                    the matter partially; and, while the advantages [?] from the old to the new
                    world are drawn [?] most fascinating colours, to conceal the priva[?] and sacrifices which must be made, and the [?] of
                    failure which may be opposed to of success.</p>
         <p>We[?] shall have occasion to prove, by the most un[?] the
                    evidence, that Upper Canada offers to emi[?] advantages, vastly
                    superior to any portion of [?] United States; but we would still admonish
                    [?] thinking to leave their native country, [?] the matter with severe
                    minuteness, not [?] away by golden dreams; and to prepare [?] should
                    they decide upon going, to meet [?] [?] from sickness, from different
                    [?], [?] labour, and privations of various [?] Yet though no step can
                    be so important as [?] leaving one native's country for ever, it is to
                    [?] that such a step is taken without due con[?]. The fancy
                    is deluded with goldren dreams; farmers[?] in America are owners of the
                    soil on [?] they live; they have no rents to pay, no tax[?]
                    their doors; possessing a noble indepen[?] they acknowledge no
                    superiority but genius [?]. These are high sounding things, but [?]
                    than solid. Before a man allows him[?] deluded by them, he
                    should remember, [?] no great hardship to pay rent, if his pro[?] three times the price in England that it [?] America;
                    that the difficulty of bringing [?] to maret, a tax, not perhaps inferior
                    [?] he had paid at home, and attended with difficulties[?] which he
                    never experience; that [?] of intercourse by good roads and canals,
                    [?] time, and the tear and wear of his car[?] amd cattle
                    are worth a very considerable sum; in removing from his native country, he
                    is [?] the improvements of a thousand years, to en[?] all
                    the rudeness of nature; that he is risking [?] happiness, and that of his
                    children, by a [?] [?] be retraced, and plunging into [?] whose manner
                    and habits are different from his own; and that he will have every thing to learn in the
                    midst of strangers.</p>
         <p>When a man has, after mature deliberation, determined to
                    emigrate, which various considerations may, in particular cases, render
                    prudent, his next question is, Where shall he go–to the United
                    States or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emigrating to be friends to the British constitution; for if they are not,
                    there is no question; because levellers and democrats will find
                    themselves in a bad situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no
                    kindred spirits there. But though we can willingly spare
                    such as these, to lose good subjects is a serious evil to the empire; and
                    to lose them through ignorance, and the want of that information which
                    it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as all evil.</p>
         <p>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the description we
                    mention, would rather prefer to remain undue their own
                    government, than to live under and swear allegiances to another, provided
                    no greater sacrifices were required in going to the one than to the
                    other. I am indeed quite certain, that many would consent willing to a
                    considerable sacrifice for this advantage, so agreeable to their feelings
                    and habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is required, and
                    that their interest, as well as inclination, when duly
                    considerd, will lead them to Upper Canada.</p>
         <p>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birkbeck's authority,
                    that 'no good settlement can be made cast of the Alleghany mountains, or in
                    the Atlantic States.' The lands are now so dear, as to be in general,
                    far beyond the reach of common emigrants, who have seldom much left after
                    landing in America.</p>
         <p>Suppose two families to land in America–one at New York, or
                    Philadelphia, on the way to Mr Birkbeck's settlement; and one at
                    Quebec, on the way to Upper Canada.</p>

                    Kingston 150 miles within the province, and lands in its neighbourhoods to
                    be sold or granted, there will be an additiona expense of
                    80 To such a family, possessed of property, government
                    might grant 200 acres, on paying fees, about 70 Or it may be purchased
                    at two dollars per acres, 130 Total expenses, 412</p>
         <p>From this calculation it is seen, that the settler, with his large family,
                    by coming to Upper Canada, instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he
                    purchases his lands at the same price, saves 928 dollars, which will
                    enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, stock it, and build a
                    comfortable house; and if he be granted the land, instead of purchasing it,
                    there is a further saving of 130 dollars.</p>
         <p>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's settlement in the
                    Illinois, and in Upper Canada, will command in the market; for,
                    notwithstanding the greatness of the first saving in coming to Upper
                    Canada, if the markets be inferior it might soon be balanced.</p>

                    Birkbeck's book, are t50 per cent, above the truth.</p>
         <p>From this table it is manifest, that the produce raised in Upper Canada
                    sells at an advance of upwards of 30 per cent on what the same
                    can be sold in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr. Birkbeck's prices
                    correct, which they are not, being much too high. The vast advantage,
                    therefore, in coming to Upper Canada, must appear manifest.</p>
         <p>It may by some be said, that the families are too numerous, as there are few
                    that consist of ten persons; but the results will be
                    proportionally the same, whatever the number be; and if we suppose them
                    to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in their own
                    country, they will commonly bring servants with them, by which
                    the average will be still greater. But this is of no moment; the difference
                    of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is sufficiently clear.</p>
         <p>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birkbeck's farmer, the
                    dearness of all those articles which he has to purchase; for his distance
                    from the seacoast and market operates in two ways to his
                        disadvantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from
                    are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great distance from the place
                    where the articles he deals in are procured, will add to the price, when he
                        disposes of the, the additional expense of bringing,
                    and the time lost in procuring them. To him who is obliged to take a
                    journey of 1600 miles to procure his articles of merchandize, the cost and
                    trouble must be very great; and all this he makes the consumer pay.
                    The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant is obliged to take is a very
                    serious one, compared to that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The
                        latter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with
                    a smaller capital than the former; because he can at any time procure
                    a fresh supply in a few days, while the former can lay in a stock of goods
                    only once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be paid for by
                    the farmers and mechanics, who consume the articles imported;
                    the difference to them, in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less
                    for the articles they sell, and paying more for those they purchase will
                    be found to be very great.</p>
         <p>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but the sun he shall get for
                    it, which constitutes the farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get
                    enough to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the farmer; it
                    is to procure the means of converting his log-cabin into a handsome and
                    convenient house– to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable
                        buildings for his cattle–to educate his
                    children–and, as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding
                    that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, and enabled him
                    to satisfy the wants of society– wants to which we are indebted for
                    amelioration of mankind.'</p>
         <p>In the selection of a place to residence in a new country, it is very
                    important to take into view the ultimate market for the farmer's produce.
                    While the country is settling, there will be no difficulty; for the
                    increasing population will demand all the supplies that can be raised. But
                    the prudent settler will look beyond that period, and consider
                    what he shall do when every one raises more grain than he will be able
                    to consume. In that case, vicinity to market, and facility of
                    transportation, are all important. Now, the produce of Upper
                    Canada can be sent to Montreal, one of the best markets in America in five or six days, at a trifling expense, which is yearly
                    diminishing as the waters are improved. Very different is the
                    case with the farmer in the western division of the United States: the
                        immense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions
                    the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and sometimes
                    exceed, the price offered when it reaches the market. The more that this
                    statement is examined, the more correct it will be found, and
                    the superior advantages of Canada will appear in a stronger
                    light; but, having been a landholder, it is time to instruct the emigrant
                    how he is to make his living out of it.</p>

         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>Among the emigrants proceeding to seek another country on the
                    shores of Southern Africa, four vessels, containing above 600 souls, have
                    sailed from Liverpool, bound to the Cape of Good Hope; three of them
                    under the command and direction of a naval officer, and one under
                    private superintendance. The public agent was instructed to provide
                    every accomodation which could minister to the health or comfort of the
                        families who were to embark</p>
         <p>Thursday afternoon, the brig Alexander sailed from Greenock with emigrants
                    for Prince Edward's island. This vessel had 85 passengers
                    on board, of which 17 were children.</p>
         <p>On Friday the ship Alexander, Young, sailed from Greenock for Quebec with 96
                    passengers.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter, dated in Perth, Upper Canada, 18th January –
                    "Liberty and Equality are the predominant principles here. A common
                    labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of land. Whenever he finds
                    he can subsist upon his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the
                    township. Every settler, though ever so poor, has a vote for the
                    member for the township, and has full liberty to speak at every meeting.
                    – It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow weaver, who came
                    among us with scarce a stitch to cover his nakedness, strutting between the
                    stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh Magistrate."</p>

         <p>Necessity of Legislative Measures for Relieving the
                        Distress of the Labouring Classes.</p>
         <p>Salus populi suprema lex.</p>
         <p>There wasa time when
                    it was held pure factiousness to doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed
                    during the first ten or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound
                    and natural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us
                    a corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy
                    anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the picture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of the full
                    measure of distress and misery which have at length fallen upon the
                    country. It would be unjust to charge the Government with any more of these
                    evils than might have been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on
                    the attention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the
                        Government accountable for all that it can remove or
                    prevent, and yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in
                        modern history, when the evil of an excess, of population
                    has come so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for
                    a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the course to be
                    pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a season of bold experiments,
                    in which we surmounted many difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if
                    timidity tie up our hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the
                    world may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has been
                    entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of the pockets of the
                    people, but that, when a period of public calamity requiress exertions of a
                    more painful kind, it is startled by the smallest difficulty,
                    and will not even make such a slight effort as might evince its sympathy
                    with the sufferers.</p>
         <p>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimulated
                    into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly we obtained of the
                    commerce of the world–by thirty or forty millions of the capital of
                    the country being annually melted down and consumed–and by the
                    continual rise of prices produced by the depreciation of the
                    currency. The great demand for labour, arising out of this state
                    of things, with the consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid
                    augmentation in the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811,
                    the rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the
                    population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing
                    districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. When
                    the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of our commercial
                    monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, and the diminuition of the
                    paper issues, the sources of our fictitious prosperity were
                    dried up at once : a vast reduction took place in the demand for labour ;
                    profits and wages fell with prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were
                    doubled, and one third added to their real amount by the rise in
                    the value of money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication
                    of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a long
                    period necessarily elapses before the population accommodates
                    itself to the diminished demand for labour, and during this
                    period the labouring classes must suffe extreme misery. In this
                    state we are at present, and time, from which we hoped relief, has only
                    aggravated the evil. There are but three remedies upon which any dependence
                    can be placed – a reduction of taxation – a change in our
                    commercial system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the
                    first, since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Government of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no
                    disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commercial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we have repeated
                    shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The reluctance of Ministers to
                    attempt a change that may prejudice the interest of some particular
                    classes, might be considered as a prudent caution, were it not observed,
                    that when, instead of relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the
                    necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but the
                    complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar clamour.
                    But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the interests of
                    a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at large. Though we shall
                    preach free trade to other nations rather with a bad grace, when
                    we can no longer hold our monopoly, it is so far well that our
                    misfortunes are at last likely to open our eyes to truths whch were
                    familiar to philosophers half a century ago. In our present circumstances,
                    we may perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has
                    impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us.</p>
         <p>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a redundant population, that we are rather surprised there should be much
                    reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not be afraid that the practise
                    will continue longer than the necessity which produces it. " The
                        vis intertiae of people in general,
                    says Malthus, and their attachment to their homes,
                    are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured they
                    will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or extreme
                    poverty, they are in such a state, as will make it as
                        muchfor the advantages of their country as of themselves that
                        theyshould go out of it." We by no means underrate the
                        difficulties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but
                    these are partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclusively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom
                    we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most
                    pressing object is to send them where they will find the means of
                    subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our own colonies
                    open to receive them. And whether they go to the United States, Brazil,
                    Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the
                    advantage to this country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries
                    of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half a
                    million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps of two years.
                    But upon whatever scale emigration is conducted it must be
                    gradual; and this renders it the more important to fix upon a plan early.
                    Ministers have lately announced that Canada cannot receive more emigrants
                    at present without inconvenience. But had the intention of
                    sending great numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn
                    would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, assured of
                    finding abundance of labourers, would have gone out and settled, and
                    provided employment for those who have not the means to establish
                    themselves as farmers. The alarm we feel of seeing manufactures raised up
                    in other countries by the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill
                    founded. Many other advantges must be combined with the possession of
                    mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the former
                    are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our capital, our improved
                    means of internal communication, our coal fields, our laws for the
                    protection of industry and property, the free, enlightened and
                    active spirit of our people, with the powers of combination resulting from
                    the union of so many advantages within so small a space, are better
                    securities for our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must
                    be nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. But
                    the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the superiority of our people in every branch of industry, will have this good
                    effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable reception. Though
                    the emigration, to afford any sensible relief to the whole
                    country, would require to be upon an extensive scale, it is yet
                    obvious, that even upon the smallest scale it is beneficial. If six
                    labourers are withdrawn from a small village, or fifty from a country town,
                    the situation of either will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by
                    Government of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fifteen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict
                    the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away men who
                    are still able to subsist by their labour, others now living on charity get
                    employment, we are in effect relieved of so many paupers. But the former
                    are less disposed to leave the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon become
                    paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to pay ten or fiften
                    pounds each to send them abroad, than to maintain them permanently home. It
                    is in vain, however, to look to private charity for the funds necessary for
                    such an undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ;
                    and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or money destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, we have
                    no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that even so great a sum
                    as five millions were required, this is but the half of what England alone
                    pays every year for poor rates ; and what is such a sum, if it were to
                    afford certain relief on an emergency lke the present? If the French and
                    Dutch should again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we
                    should quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few
                    hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how easily
                    would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing more is requisite than to
                    take on half of the sum for two years, which Mr Vansittart allots for paying off the national debt. We
                    not only conceive that it would be wise and creditable to divert a part, or
                    the whole of the actual Sinking Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as
                    to think, that it is little less than disgraceful to pay off any
                    debt at all at this crisis with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving
                    population. Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that
                    the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its nature,
                    cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. We have not only an
                    excess of population to dispose of, but we have to check the principle of
                    increase, which is rapidly aggravating the evil. In the five years ending
                    1810, the population of England added one-seventieth part to its
                    numbers annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same
                    for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 individuals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the whole of this
                    vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present excess of numbers will not
                    diminish but augment. And how is it to be got rid of? Either the annual
                    births must diminish more than one-third, or famine and disease must
                    destroy a quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the usual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate together. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring
                    classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is not still
                    on the increase, and whether still more afflicting scenes are not awaiting
                    us. Indeed, unless measures are taken to do away the factitious stimulus
                    which the English poor laws give to the increase of population,
                    the most abundant emigration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather
                    discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in some
                    way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now become
                    rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or two millions of human
                    beings have been suddenly deprived of their means of subsistence by events
                    over which they had no control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to
                        desperation by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden
                    revulsion in trade– a more general exclusion of our manufactures by
                    the Americans,–any of those numerous casualties, in short
                    to which every nation is exposed, would place us in a situation
                    frightful to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a continual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and
                    capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent,
                    experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce no
                    material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief which is may
                    ultimately bring, will be obtained only through the destruction of vast
                    multitudes by famine and disease. In the fifth year of peace, it is now
                    time to look the evil in the face, and either to make some great sacrifices
                    for its removal, or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It
                    is in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those who
                    propose to leave things to what they call the course of nature, are in
                    substance recommending that thousands of their fellow-creatures should be
                    suffered to rot away from the effect of absolute want. That such a thing
                    should take place in the</p>

            <pb n="4"/> Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated 22d November,
                    1819:--"An afflicting circumstance has recently taken place. The Captain of
                    the Bengal, a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board his
                    ship, which was about to sail for England. The party was very small, and
                    more than half were taken ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards.
                    I buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after it; not less
                    than ten of the part died within as many days, all younger persons. Only
                    one officer survives of those who left England in the ship, and he is just
                    recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures were made, but it
                    turns out that there were 17,000 undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a
                    complete state of putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for England in this state without a Surgeon. I question whether it
                    will ever arrive; it ought not to be admitted among other
                    shipping if it does;–the opening of the hold will be death to him
                    who does it, and perhaps to many more."--In consequence of this
                        disastrous information, Ministers have issued an order for
                    the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other part, to undergo
                        quarantine.–London Paper.</p>
         <p>All apprehension on the above subject is completely done away by
                    the following letter from Liverpool, May 14:–</p>
         <p>"I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, respecting the Bengal, of this
                    port, at Calcutta, stating that a number of deaths had taken
                    place, supposed in consequence of the Infectious vapours arising
                    from some buffalo horns.–The Bengal arrived here April 5, and
                    has been discharged without any of those dreadful consequences which the
                    medical gentlemen of Calcutta prognosticated.–I should
                    rather suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued to those
                    individuals who attended the ball given on board this vessel at Calcutta,
                    would be none justly attributed to the exposure to night air."</p>

         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a private letter dated</p>
         <p>"Halifax, May 22 "At two o'clock this day the Earl of Dalhousie, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of British North America,
                    attended by the Admiral, his Majesty's Council, the staff, naval
                    and military officers, and the principal people of the place, attended
                    to lay the first stone of a new college, to be erected at the north end of
                    the grand parade. The whole of the freemasons of Halifax went in grand
                    procession. They formed in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a
                    military band, and followed by another, they marched to the places
                    prepared for them on the building.</p>
         <p>"His Lordship came on the scaffolding at two o'clock, the grenadiers of the
                    62d regiment being his guard of honour. Detachments from each regiment
                    kept the ground.</p>
         <p>"After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie
                    addressed the assembly in a speech, of which I have not time to give
                    an outline ; but in it his Lordship mentioned, that the building
                    was intendeed as a college upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all
                    students who professed the Christian religion were eligible for
                    admittance. Strangers residing here for a short time might also enjoy the
                        benefit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army,
                    the navy, and the military establishments. His Lordship concluded a
                    most eloquent and animated address with his fervent wishes for
                    the welfare and prosperity of the undertaking.</p>
         <p>"A bottle with coins, and a tin case with parchments, &amp;c. were then
                    severally deposited in the recess made for them, and the stone was
                    lowered into its place with all the requisite and due forms, under a
                    royal salute from fort Charlotte ; after which the Rev. the
                    Grand Chaplain closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the whole
                    assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– The military and masonic
                    processions then returned in the same order, in which they
                    came.</p>
         <p>The day was beautiful, and a greater assemblage of people was
                    never witnessed in Halifax.</p>
         <p>"The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, Mrs Admiral Griffith and the
                    Misses Wilson, and most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the
                    ceremony from a convenient scaffolding prepared for
                    them.</p>
         <p>"Lord Dalhousie purposes to leave Halifax for Quebec in his Majesty's ship
                    Newcastle, on the 1st of June, without waiting for Sir James
                    Kempt."</p>
         <p>Court of Chancery–June 10.</p>
         <p>Will of the Late Duke of QueensberryMr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from the annuitants
                    and legates of the late Duke of Queensberry, praying that a
                    fourth more of their claims might be paid, there now being sufficient funds
                    in the hands of the Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned
                        Counsel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000
                    accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in Bank stock, for
                    the benefit of the claimants, and he understood it was not
                    intended to oppose the application, although the executors did
                    not say they would give their consent to it. Some consultation had been had
                    on the subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer of
                    the petition should be granted.</p>
         <p>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any instructions,
                    nor had he been consulted.</p>
         <p>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of their respective
                    clients.</p>
         <p>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and said his Lordship was
                    anxious that the business should be put in a train of settlement.</p>
         <p>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing that had a heart in
                    him but must wish the legacies and annuities to be paid ; but, said his
                    Lordship, the Marquis of Queensberry has commenced an action for the
                    recovery of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a
                    right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court should
                    see that no harm arose to the executors, before the funds were allowed to
                    go out of Court. With respect to their not opposing the petition, that was
                    very different to consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, " Mind
                    you do right."</p>
         <p>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth was too much, they
                    would take an eight, or any part his Lordship pleased.</p>
         <p>The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on the paper for
                    Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will look over the petition.</p>

         <p>The New York Daily Advertiser says–"The line of battle ship New
                    York, now finishing at our navy yard, at the Wallabut, is perhaps the most
                    superior vessel ever built. Her tonnage is near 3000[?]: she measures
                    203 feet keel, and is by 15 feet the largest man of war ever laid down in
                    this country. She will no doubt be rated a 74, but will be equal to a
                    100 gun-ship, and will carry 120 guns."</p>

         <p>India</p>
         <p>We have great pleasure in publishing the following interesting letter from
                    India: –</p>
         <p>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. "I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to
                    communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the legitimate
                    object of all Government, it is good to learn that British India is at
                    peace, and that a temperate and radical reform is gradually going on under
                    the Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establishment
                    of schools, and a free press, are the moving principles by which
                    this great advancement in the state of society will be accomplished, unless
                    checked by impious powers.</p>
         <p>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary here to dilate.
                    Suffice it to observe, that it is in the power of any Government, abitrary
                    or free, to educate the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance
                    them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in theshortest possible period.</p>
         <p>"The establishment of a free press in Asia is, in my
                    estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever adorned the
                    biography of any Statesman. What, say its detractors, is setting loose a
                    parcel of printer's devils so great an act? No, but setting loose all the
                        intelligence of the age to work upon the public mind and
                    conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it asserted that a
                    free press is only applicable to an advanced state of society, I
                    deny the position ; it is not founded in reason or experience. I contend on
                    the other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil exist, there
                    is the greatest scope for improvement ; and I offer Scotland as a proof of
                    the efficacy[?] of education and a free press.</p>
         <p>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of India, has, in the newspapers
                    of Madras and Calcutta, been accused of having sent two persons of the name
                    of Hastings, to unhealthy climates, the one to the
                    East and the other to the West Indies, where they died
                        ;and for the base purpose of securing to his family
                    the title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was touching his
                    sensitive honour to the quick ; and it would seem as if some one inimical
                    to a free press, had introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this
                    virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, allowed
                    this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood refuted in every bosom,
                    and his manly forbearance tended but to give further proofs of his
                    attachment to our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made on
                    Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, they say, of these alleged
                    libels to the Chief Magistrate, who desired him to have
                        recourse to the law Conceive not, however, that I am the advocate
                    for a licentious press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mischievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well applied,
                    beneficial, in proportion to its strength.</p>
         <p>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, has done
                    away with the Censorship of the Press. This wise Statesman,
                    being a friend to freedom, and having experienced
                    the benefits which had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a
                    day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light by the press),
                    adopted it the moment he came into power, and thus proved himself a public
                    benefactor.</p>
         <p>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the diffusion of knowledge,
                    through the medium of education and a free press, will more than
                    any other measure accelerate the improvement and heighten the
                        prosperity, not only of British India, but of the
                        surrounding world."</p>

                    same having been dispatched by Captain Sheriff, of the Andromache frigate, to survey the coast, had explored it for 200 miles. The
                    captain went ashore found it covered with snow, and uninhabited. Abundance
                    of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. He has named the
                    island New Shetland.</p>
         <p>Accounts from Constantinople, dated May 26, annouce, that the
                    armaments against Ali Pacha are upon the most formidable scale, and are
                    actively pursued.– The latter has obtained hostages of his principal
                        officers, as pledges of their fidelity. On the 14th, two
                    new hips of the line were launched in the presence of the Sultan and
                    his Grand Dignitaries, at the hour fixed by the chief astrologers. The
                    navigation between Bagdad[?] and Bassurah has been free since the defeat of
                    the Arabs by the English. The latter, it is stated, have facilitated
                    the intercourse between those two places by the establishment of
                    parket-boats.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Proposed New Monarchy in South America</p>
         <p>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, by the Blossom sloop of War,
                    of a curious nature.– They relate to a project said to have been in
                    agitation for placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head of
                    an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– The circumstance has
                    been brought to light by the late changes in the Government of Buenos
                    Ayres. From the documents now published, and received by the Blossom,
                    it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris,
                    was invited to a conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for
                    Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communicate a
                    project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolidation of the
                    Independent Government of South America.</p>
         <p>This project, the French Minister observed, would meet with the decided
                    approbation of the Continental Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great
                    Britain might not like it, but yet would not find any good pretence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would
                    yield to the influence of all Europe with the better grace, as his
                    former dependencies would be only transferred to a branch of his
                    own family. The King of France would furnish assistance of every king, and
                        employ every means, even to the supply of troops, for carrying the affair into execution.</p>
         <p>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of his conference reached
                    Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then Director ad interim made
                    a secret communication to the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter
                    of the Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the following
                    day, and on the 3d of November, the matter was discussed in secret
                    meetings, and the result was an[?] opinion, that the Constitution
                    lately-sworn allowed no alteration to be made in the form of Government
                    till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch of the Bourbon
                    family, so closely connected with the reigning Monarch of Spain, was in
                    itself an insuperable objection, as also the consideration that the Prince
                    proposed and supported by the Powers of the European
                    Continent, would naturally more incline towards the views of his protectors
                    than towards those of South America, which ought to avoid all connexion
                    with European continental politics ; and that Great Britain was
                    the power from which South America had most to fear, and most to
                    expect.</p>
         <p>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in Europe shoud put the
                    communications from Paris into the hands of the British Minstry,
                    whose good opinion and protection South America is most anxious
                    to conciliate.</p>
         <p>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Americans with the
                    greatest reserve, as if feating contamination by simple
                    contact–a delicacy towards Spanish interests and feelings
                    which appears in itself commendable, but, when measured by the
                    standard of national benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it
                    would seem that the British interest is likely to gain the ascendacy
                    in the river Plate, rather through the disposition of the inhabitants, than
                    from any influence exerted by our Ministers.</p>
         <p>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was carried on by the Duke
                    de Cazes, the project did not originate with him, and did not at first
                    apply to the Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for one
                    more nearly allied to the reigning family in France.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>We extract the following statement from the MontrealHerald and an important one it is, to those who are
                    desirous of emigrating, as well as to those, who, from patriotic
                    motives, would wish to turn the tide of emigration into a
                    channel which, while it relieve the mother country now, may
                    hereafter add to her strength and resources :</p>
         <p>Number of British subjects that emigrated to the UnitedStates, who received recommendations for grants ofland, and removed to the province of Upper Canada,from James Buchanan, Esq. his Majesty's Consul atNew York, in the year 1819: –</p>
         <p>English { Farmers..... 180 Women..... 118 Children.....
                    157 Mechanics..... 117 Women..... 57 Children..... 92 } 1021 Scotch { Farmers..... 50 Women..... 11 Children..... 15
                    Mechanics..... 30 Women..... 9 Children..... 36 } 131 Irish { Farmers..... 184 Women..... 94 Children..... 319
                    Mechanics..... 75 Women..... 42 Children..... 98 } 810
                    Total.........1962</p>
         <p>We cannot give publicity to the above return, without observing
                    how eminently calculated such a document is, to open the eyes of
                    our too credulous, yet industrious and loyal countrymen ; many
                    of whom are still disposed to look to the United Statesm, as the abode
                    of independence and the source of affluence. Here we see nearly 2000
                    British subjects, who, in one season, through the agency alone of one of
                    our Consuls(withoutany pecuniary aid), have removed from the
                    United States to Upper Canada. Their trieal and failure in the former,
                    as well as the trial and failure of the great numbers who have returned to
                    this country, are circumstances well calculated to direct the
                    attention of those who have emigration in view, at once to Upper Canada. We have made enquiry about these hitherto unknown, but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed from a most
                    authentic and satisfactory source, that there there are unlocated lands,
                    fertile beyond the conception of those who have not seen them, capable of
                    receiving ten millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so
                    cold, nor the summers so hot, as in the State of New York ; that these
                    regions have proved eminently healthy to the vast numbers that have poured
                    into them of late years ; and that the administration of the laws, the
                    state of education and religious instruction, and above all, the peace
                    and quiet of the inhabitants have found there, have exceed their most
                    sanguine expectations.</p>
         <p>It may be desirable to state, that grown persons can get by water from
                    Quebec to York, the capital of Upper Canada, for about 28s ; children, half
                    price ; that to all persons properly recommended as to good conduct, a
                    grant of land is given according to their means of cultivation ; that this
                    grant becomes their own for ever, and they may dispose of it as they
                    please.</p>

         <p>Colony at the Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>(Extract of a Letter, dated off Madeira) Aurora Transport Ship, Feb 19.</p>
         <p>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting a hasty account of the
                    Aurora and Brilliant transports, proceeding with settlers to the Cape of
                    Good Hope, I feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance, with
                    a view as well to gratify our friends in England, as to add another
                    confirmation of the liberality of Government in our important
                    undertaking. First, it will be necessary to state, that the two ships sail
                    in company, and are every day within hail of each other ; the
                    former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter by Captain
                    Bothwell, who is accompanied by Lieutenant Pritchard, as agent
                    to both vessels.</p>
         <p>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our course down Channel was most favourable,
                    and the weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, disease, or
                    serious accident has occurred in either ship and blooming health and vigour
                    now rapidly succeed the langour produced by a sudden transition to a new
                        element. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?]
                    oatmeal, peas, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt pork, and
                    beef, of excellent quality, are liberally supplied, together
                    with a proper allowance of rum, vinegar, mustard and spices. The
                    ships are fitted up in every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the
                    most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings amongst the old
                    women about fractured teapots and mislaid culinary articles. The attention
                    paid to the comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that of
                    the women and children, by the Captains, and the agent (Mr Pritchard), is
                    highly creditable to the instructions received from
                    Government.</p>
         <p>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Captain Bothwell. I have
                    had ample proofs of the kindness and humane liberality which he
                    shews to the passengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an
                    active, intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Transport Service under Government : he has sailed to almost every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our place of
                    destination, is quite familiar to him.</p>
         <p>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust I may be excused in
                    boasting, that of the crew and 240 passengers, not one is seriously
                    indisposed at present, and wishing, with heartfelt sincerity, to my friends
                    in England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good health as I
                    now enjoy, long may they live, long live the Constitution: and while on
                    Fish River or Orange River we encounter the difficulties
                    incident to new colonists, may England and South Africa be ever
                    united by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her
                    parental arms, and the other mindful of her filial duty. P. Campbell., Surgeon.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape of Good Hope, to the 22d
                    October, and they are satisfactory in all points of view, but
                    especially with reference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay.
                    His Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was taking some
                    effectual measures to place the coinage of the colony upon a better
                    footing, and on the 13th of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying
                    a very large quantity of base money. He has also taken measure to
                    communicate to the new settlers from England the full benefit ofthe Courts
                    of Justice esblished in that quarter of the world.</p>
         <p>We have received an account of the loss of the Abeona[?]
                    transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, with settlers. The following is
                    an extract of a letter from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec.
                    "The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th inst. from
                    Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who escaped from the Abeona transport,
                    bound to the Cape of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the
                    25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. The Agent,
                    Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls,
                    got into three boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da
                    Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."</p>
         <p>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, which give detailed
                    accounts of the number and state of the slaves in that part of the West
                    Indies. The report is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new
                    Slave Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial statement of
                    the slave population, and the Reporter makes some judicious comparative
                    remarks. It appears that there has been a large decrease of the
                        number by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as
                    compared with the former year. Births have been in the proportion of
                    one to forty-six. The Report defends the [?] of the West India
                    Planters, and observes that the state of the Black population
                    serves[?] to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the kindness, the
                    liberality, and induglent care of propiertors. It adds, that
                    their own interests is a perpetual[?] evil[?] upon their
                    humanity. In the colony there [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]
                    slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles and there are 38,910
                    female slaves of the same donomination, making a total of
                    76,929. The slave population in 1817, amounted in the whole to
                    77,867.– The number of births which have occurred since that
                    period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report concludes
                    with some gratifying observations upon the flourishing state of the
                    colony.</p>

                    has been deemed convenient, with a view to the information and guidance of
                    individuals interest in this subject, to state, that, 1stly, Persons are not provided with passages, at the public expense
                    to any of his Majesty's settlements. 2dly,
                    Persons proceeding at their own expense to North America, and to the Cape
                    of Good Hope, and desirous of settling there, require no previous authority
                    from his Majesty's Secretary of State to enable them to obtain grants of
                    land, the Governor of those settlements being fully empowered to
                    assign lands to applicants, proportioned to the means which they actually
                    possess for bringing them into a state of cultivation. The extent of these
                    grants must depend upon their quality, position, and other circumstances,
                    which can only be ascertained in the Colony. 3dly, Persons desirous of settling in New South Wales or
                    Van Diemen's Land must be provided with the sanction of his Majesty's
                    Secretary of State ; and this can only be obtained upon written application, accompanied by references to two or more respectable
                    persons, as to the character of the applicant, and the extent of his
                    capital, which must amount to Five Hundred Pounds, at the least.</p>

         <p>Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans–The following extract of a letter from Bombay bringing this
                    intelligence, we copy from Carrick's Post, which appears to have exclusive
                    means of obtaining information on India affairs:–</p>
         <p>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. "While I was seeing the last of your goods on
                    board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour having
                    on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hearer of the
                    official intelligence of the complete success of Sir Charles Culville's
                    expedition against the Sindeans. The expedition consisted of
                    12,000 men, commanded by his Excellency the Commander in Chief ; from
                    all I could clean of intellience from the followers, it appeared there had
                    been some hard fighting for five days ; but it ended, as might
                    be anticipated, from the imposing force sent against the
                    Sindeans. The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and an
                    Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government House, to inform Lady
                    Colville of the event, as it must be supposed she was in a state og
                    anxiety, her husband being the commander, and her brother, and her
                    uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expedition. At
                    day-light this morning orders arrived from the Government House, to secure
                    a passage and private cabin for the officer in th ship which
                    takes this to England, but there was no such accomodation, as the
                    cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not sail from thence
                    about ten days, this and will be off to-day, the chance is, you will have
                    this letter at least six weeks before the officers can reach England with
                    the official intelligence. All kinds of European produce
                    are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and rum, brandy, and geneva, are
                    for a song. The cholera has rather abated, but still rages in a
                    frightful manner."</p>
         <p>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with letters to the
                    21st of November. Advices had been received from Rio Grande,
                    stating that Artigas had been taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate,
                    Union, had captured two insurgent privateers which had been committing depredations on the coast. The events in Portugal, owing to which, as well as to the idea that the King
                    would be prudent enough to sanction what had taken place in Portugal, the
                    prices of produce had experienced very trifling alteration,
                    though, if the contrary should be the case, a considerable rise
                    was anticipated. The following relates to what is passing in
                    Peru :–</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated November 20
                    :–" The Chilians have at length carried into effect their boasted
                    expedition, which left Valparaiso on the 21st August, and arrived at Pisco
                    at the beginning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men,
                    but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent away from
                    the estates in that quarter, so that they will be disappointed in meeting
                    with partisans ; indeed the slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to
                    find favourable to their views, are the most irritated against the
                    insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th September, which speaks
                    of the little apprehensions entertained of San Martin and his
                    troops, the Viceroy having a formidable force, in the capital and vicinity,
                    of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The Viceroy, is
                    Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, and La Mar and O'Reilly command
                    divisions. They were observin San Martin's movements who already
                    experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The Marquis of
                    Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a strong detachment of cavalry, with a
                    view to prevent him from sending emissaries into the interior, and collecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon have
                    to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little pressed for provisions,
                    and fighting comes on, numbers will desert. Those who have
                    already come over describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels,
                    one an English, and the other a French, were preparing to
                    sail from Callao for this place, and by them we shall receive further
                    particulars. The most enthusiastic preparations were making in
                    Lima to proclaim the constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose
                    orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself is sufficient to
                    defeat all views Cochrane and San Martin may have on the
                    country, except, as before, a little plunder on the open and
                    defenceless parts of the coast.</p>
         <p>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. mention that the whole
                    squadron was lying there.– The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and
                    Thistle, were lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to complete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was obliged to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of her
                    very sickly state. She had recently arrived from the River Gambia, whither
                    she had proceeded in dread of attack by the natives on our infant colony
                    there. A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, by the
                    merchants of that colony, for the very able manner in which he
                    brought to an amicable conclusion the differences between the Native Chiefs
                    and the British interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from the
                    Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belonging to the mission
                    under Major Gray, for exploring Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in
                        consequence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed
                    further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; he will not proceed
                    further for some time.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 16th of December have been received. It is
                    satisafactory to learn that some more effectual measures, than any before
                    adopted by the French Government, to prevent slave trading are now in
                    a course of execution. The French brig of war, Le Huron, of 22 guns,
                    Commodore Du Pressit, is employed in cruizing for that
                    purpose.</p>
         <p>Earthquake at Zante, Jan. 8.–The last week
                    has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.– At four
                    o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. we had a violent shock of an
                    earthquake, which lasted nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight
                    other shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw down one
                    thousand three hundred houses. Providentially, the first shock
                    did not throw down many, so that the inhabitants had time to escape before
                        succeeding shocks, otherwise theloss would have been
                        dreadful. Only ten lives have been lost, but not a house
                    in the town has escaped without some injury. The town is still in a
                    complete state of confusion ; one thousand give hundred houses more, being
                    so much injured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all
                    the steeples in the place must be taken down. The streets are almost
                    impassable from the fallen houses ; and great caution is required, in
                    walking, to avoid the ruins that are still falling.</p>

         <p>Emigration to Canada</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman belonging to
                    Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Canada, to a friend in
                    this city :–</p>
         <p>"York, Upper Canada, 14th November, 1820. "You wish
                    to be informed of the encouragement that you might meet with by an
                    emigration to this country; and as you have determined to place the most
                    implicit confidence in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you
                    the "truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me God."– In the first place, you wish to know what might be
                    the value of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of
                    improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a decided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation where you wish
                    to purchase; but I may with safety average wild land, in this
                    Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dollars per acre, and the clearing
                    or improving of each acre will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.–In the
                    next place, you wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been
                    known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can be purchased
                    at 20 dollars, a pair of working oxen at 40 dollars; a good cart horse at
                    50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars a piece. In regard to farming
                    utensils, there are but few used in this country at any time, and a new
                    settler may be some years in the woods before we want any more than an
                    axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dollars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government grant; that has
                    now become no object, as the charges made by Government exceed in many
                    cases what you can purchase land for; and by buying land you
                    have the advantage of choosing a situation agreeable to your
                    mind; but the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Government, for you must then take your chance by drawing by
                    lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty miles round this
                    place, you will then be obliged to go back into the woods, and out of the
                    world. You are at liberty to sell it as soon as you receive the grant;
                    formerly you could.–You wish to know what sum you could establish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one
                    thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and
                    difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend, I would
                    advise you not to think of leaving home with a sum less than t200 sterling
                    with a sum less than this you undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and
                    troubles that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here for
                    nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my pend to describe;
                    and my greatest enemy I should not advise to come to this
                    country, with the intention of farming, with less capital than I have no
                    stated to you. Many may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams
                    about this country; but you must allow the experience that I have had
                    to outweigh the statements of many that you may have had an opportunity of
                    talking with, who may pretend to have some knowledge of this
                    country, for there are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls
                    of Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not
                    visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may
                    think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine myself to
                    wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article in this country; and
                    should you think of farming, I would advise you to bring but few fine
                    clothes, but principally coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind
                    becomes very expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as
                    this, and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of the
                    repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the transportation
                    of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) is 2 dollars per cwt.; and
                    from Kingston to York (200 miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel
                    bulk; and from Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for
                    each grown person.–By the by, you wish to know the population of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to some of your
                    towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of York might amount to 3000
                    people. But there is no place that I have visited in my travels that is
                    more thriving than this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is
                    now twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three years),
                    and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; but all
                    wood.–You wish to know the different branches of business carried on
                    here. They are principally house carpenters; and various other
                    mechanics are also employed here.–You wish to know if any of the
                    emigrants have arrived in this place. There are but very few I
                    understand come thus far, the greater part of them having stopped at a
                    settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. –Since I
                    have now given answers to all your different queries, let me now give my
                    candid opinion respecting this country. In the first instance, a farmer may
                    live by hard labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a
                    complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the farmer of
                    this country; and in some places you may live for years and not even
                    behold, a silver dollar through a glass darkly, as all is done by barter in
                    the country. The next evil is the mixture of society; a very few good,
                    intermixed with a multitude of a very different character; but in many
                    places you will be divested of all society, either of a good or bad
                    quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you will find yourself
                    uncomfortable, in consequence of its being so much different to what you
                    have been accustomed to; and the opportunity of spending the
                    sabbath in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And above
                    all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is the ruin of many a
                    family in this country. But should you think of coming to this country, in
                    order to avoid this disease I would advise you to come no farther up the
                        country than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness
                    is seldom known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated here I neither
                    mean to advise or dissuade you from coming to this country; but
                    take it into serious consideration before you embark upon this
                    important."</p>

      <text>
         <p>Canada</p>
         <p>Provincial Parliament of Lower CanadaQuebec Legislative Council–March 17.</p>
         <p>This day his Excellency the Governor in Chief made the following[?] speech
                    to both Houses:–</p>
         <p>"Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of
                    Assembly,</p>
         <p>"When the Parliament met for the dispatch of public business[?], I did
                    entertain a hope that the experience of the [?] few years would have led
                    you to a mature and serious consideration[?] of the consequences that would
                    inevitably follow[?], if the then state of things should not be remedied ;
                    I[?] cannot therefore be surprised that I should now express[?] not only my disappointment, but great concern that [?] same
                    question of constitutional principle should have [?]ia disturbed the
                    unanimity of your legislative proceedings[?].</p>
         <p>"Upon this occasion I think it a duty which I owe to [?] and to your country
                    to call upon you to consider, during[?] this summer, the result
                    of the discussions of the sessesion[?] in all its bearings.</p>
         <p>"You will see the administration of the civil government[?] left
                    without any pecuniary means but what I shall advance[?] upon my own
                    personal responsibility ; you will [?] individuals suffering under severe
                    and unmerited hardships[?], caused by the wast of that
                    constitutional authority that[?] is necessary for the payment of the
                    expences of the civil[?] government. You will see the interior improvements[?] of the country nearly at a stand ; you will see, in
                    [?]ort, the executive government in a manner palsied and
                    powerless[?].</p>
         <p>"When I shall again summon you to meet here in Parliament[?], you
                    will come to decide the important question, whether[?] the Government shall
                    be restored to its constitutional[?[ energy, or whether you are
                    to deplore the prospect [?] lasting misfortune, by a continuance in the
                    present state [?] things. Important as that question is, there can be no
                    difficulty[?[ in the decision. When the blessingsof the British[?] constitution were granted to this province, you re[?]ved with it the recorded experience of centuries of [?]ctise. There is
                    no question of doubt or of difficulty [?]that may not find its precedent in
                    the records of the Im[?]Imperial Parliament ; and I cannot thik
                    that any wiser [?]guide need by desired."</p>
         <p>After which, the Honourable Speaker of the Legislative [?]council said, that
                    it was the pleasure of his Excellency the [?]Governor in Chief that the
                    Provincial Parliament should [?] prorogued until Thursday, the 26th of
                    April next.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. The active exertions of the
                    Governor to improve the inland navigation had given very general
                    satisfaction. In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parliament, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less than
                    three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhousie, to be
                    forwarded to the King ; one respecting the allowance of half-pay to the
                    Militia ; another respecting the duties imposed in British ports
                    on lumber from Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained by
                    the people of Canada, during the late war. His excellency the Governor had
                    intimated, that no objection would be made to the repeal of the
                    grant of 2,500l on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided
                    the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver
                    General, and that of the Speaker of the House of Assembly,
                    should be continued, in the whole amounting to 1,800l. The grant has for
                    some time been a prominent subject of complaint in the Colonial
                        Parliament.</p>
         <p>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in Lower Canada is about to
                    leave the Colony for England. The Staff Corps was to proceed to
                    the Ottawa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing
                    the obstructions in that river.</p>
         <p>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that a messenger was leaving
                    that place to announce the union of the North and Hudson's Bay Companies, at their respective establishments. The former of
                    these companies was under control of Lord Selkirk, and the
                    schism that has so long reigned between them, with its fatal consequences,
                    is well know to the Public.</p>
         <p>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships have been taken up by the
                    vigilant Governor, on board of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to
                    the Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the surprise of
                    the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, under the direction of a
                    young man. The gallant Gen. Lionel Smith has been selected for this
                    important service ; and we have no doubt but that he will
                    convince the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceedings, and justify the high confidence which the Government of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– His
                    Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recovered, is gone on a
                    tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, and to ascertain the true situation
                    of the country.– How important it is for the Heads of the
                    Presidencies, thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trusting to mere reports. This proves the benefits of appointing men of experience and energy in the conduct of our
                    Indian Empire–which is now, throuh the admirable conduct of the
                    Governor General, and the two other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled,
                        tranquility and prosperity.</p>

         <p>Van Dieman's Land</p>
         <p>We have been favoured with the following extract of a letter from
                    Captain Dixon, of the ship Skelton, dated Hobert Town, Van Dieman's
                    Land, 29th November 1820 :–</p>
         <p>"We arrived here on the 27th inst. all in good health.– This colony
                    surpasses my expectation–climate very similar to England,
                    soil capable of any thing, where an industrious manhas every thing to hope
                    and nothing to fear ; the assistance given to settlers liberal,
                    and grants of land to the amount of from 400 to 2000 acres given
                    them, generally of excellent quality. This colony in fact is the
                    only country that an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate
                    not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the same, except
                    burning wood for coals. The country on the sea coast is very woody, but
                    much easier cleared than America and about ten miles in the
                    interior several miles of extent have no wood at all. The ships
                    behaves beautifully, sails well, and is easy ; we have never close reefed
                    and not above twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor
                    split a sail."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate
                    of the ship Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, 29th
                    November 1820 :–</p>
         <p>"I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the ship Guildford,
                    which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and then homewards. We left the
                    Table Bay on 18th October, and arrived here on 28th November, making a very
                    good passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the
                    island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went ashore on
                    the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours, found it to be barren
                    entirely–only inhabited by give or six people from the Isle of
                    France, for the purpose of sealing. When we came near the land, fell in
                    with various winds and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve
                    o'clock, and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The
                    country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but
                    interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here
                    now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregularly built, just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden
                    houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly of
                    the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy Governor was very
                    favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to be here from Sidney in the course of a
                    fortnight or three weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers
                    are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves to Sydney,
                    or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; coarse ship biscuits
                    35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, 21s. and every thing in like
                    proportion. Salted pork would have sold very well–could clear L130 a
                    cwt. Beef is about 6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you
                    pay more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, they were
                    mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement here for pickpockets. Some
                    of the richest and most powerful men here have once been sent
                    out as convicts, but, from their good behaviour, got their emancipation.
                    The Midship Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig
                    trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me they can chuse
                    what land they like ; but not the quality ; they must apply the saw and the
                    hatchet a great deal. A hatchet costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have
                    female servants, as they can't trust them ; as those who come out are
                    convicts, and get soon married, so they have all men servants."</p>

         <p>American Papers.</p>
         <p>New York, May 8. The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at Stonington,
                    last Tuesday, in seventy-three days from New South Iceland, with a cargo of
                    oil. ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S. long. 35. W. spokethe Brig
                    Wilner, of London, from Buenos Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the
                        Captain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian
                    army, near Peru, had fought two battles with the Royal army, in both
                    of which the Chilian army was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause
                    the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians.</p>
         <p>May 15. The gigantic projects that occupy the attention of
                    our countrymen are truly surprising. A plan is now forming, for example, to
                    establish a settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, for the
                    purpose of importing teas direct from the East Indies. It is then proposed
                    to transport this article of merchandize up the Columbia, until it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to proceed by land to the
                    navigable branch of the Missouri. This embraces a space of three
                    hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this distance 200
                    miles are represented by travellers as constituting an excellent road ; the
                    remaining one hundred and forty comprehend the mountain
                    barrier, which must be passed by the intrepidity and labour of
                    man. The merchandize will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its
                    subsidiary streams, supply the whole western continent with the
                    refreshing beverage. This shows the varied changes of commerse ; the
                    Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium of supplying our
                    western States with the productions of China ; but if this plan
                    should be carried into effect, we may receive our supply from that
                    country through the western States.</p>
         <p>May 16. It is worthy of remark, that among the numerous
                    arrivals at this port yesterday, were three British brigs from Dundee. This
                    makes good the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that Dundee was
                    becoming a place of considerable trade.</p>

         <p>Africa.–Extract of a Letter from Capt. Colliver,
                    a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, and who is an Officer
                    in the service of the African Comapny:–</p>
         <p>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. By the time you have received this, it is
                    probable the African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have
                    received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver up the
                    Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It is understood they are to be
                    put on the same footing as Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to
                        Government by the Company's Committee, of their Officers,
                    their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; their
                    emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, since the 10th of
                    February, by the Ashantees[?] (an African tribe), who have
                    commenced hostilities against us. On the day before mentioned, our Governor
                    received intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, where
                    the people are under our protection, had been cruelly murdered by a Chief
                    of the Fantes[?], at a place about six miles from Cape Coast, called
                    Moree[?]. I was immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I
                    could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize the murderer. I
                    quickly set off with four officers and 85 soliders. A little before we
                    entered the town of Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in
                    number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains of their unforunate
                    victim. The town stands near the top of a hill, on the summit of which is
                    an old Dutch Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was opened
                    upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the murderer, if possible, without
                    bloodshed, I did not for some time allow the men to return the fire.
                    However, perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave directions to my little party to give them a volley and then
                    to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, and in less than an hour we
                    gained the hill, from which our opponents fled in every firection. We
                    demanded the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging to
                    Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had remained, and
                    who immediately gave them up. In the fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were
                    perfectly secure from the attack of the negroes. The body we
                        defeated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the
                    Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands made by them on the
                    people of Cape Coast. As soon as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast,
                    learned that the Governor had sent an armed force against their
                    friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened after us ;
                    fortunately we had defeated our opponents before they arrived. However,
                    they rallied the Fantees, and took a position about half a mile
                    from the town, with a determination to oppose our little party. The
                    Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled all the forces he could
                    muster, and speedily about 500 of the Cape Coast people, headed by our
                    officers, and carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The
                    enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from our disagreeable
                    situation, after having been from nine in the morning till four in the
                    afternoon exposed to a burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had
                    47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; we had one
                    soldier killed, and four wounded. Since the affair, we have not seen one of
                    the Ashantees or the Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken
                    place. We have not learned how the King of Ashantee intends
                    to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our limits, except in large
                    parties.</p>
         <p>New South Shetland–The Lord Melville, J.
                    Clark, master has arrived in the London Docks from the New South
                    Shetland fishery, which he left on the 31st of March, having on board the
                    following persons, belogning to the crews of the undermentioned vessels,
                    which had been wrecked, and whom he landed at Buenos Ayres, on the

         <p>Captain Clark, also carried to Buenos Ayres the crew of the American
                    schooner Venus, Capt. Nappue. He sailed from the River Plate on the 28th of
                    April, and reached the Downs on the 31st ult. Capt. Clark left a small
                    colony at Easter Harbour, consisting of the following
                    individuals:–R. Gibbs, of London first officer of the Lord Melville
                    ; G. Robertson, of Hamburgh, second officer of the Minerva, a vessel reported lost, but since arrived in the Brazils ; J. Jornan, of Leith, boatswain of the Lord Melville ; P. Howson,
                    of Carron, carpenter ; J. Lockey, of Essex ; J. Semple, of Dundee ; J. Ash,

                    Roberts, of Liverpool ; and J. Havers, of Harwich,
                    seamen.–They were left in good health and spirits, with a stock of
                    twelve months provisions, and all the materials necessary for erecting
                    three or four houses.</p>

         <p>Alarming Fires in the Woods of Main andNew Brunswick.–A gentleman, who arrived
                    here on Thursday, in the schooner Active, from Eastport, informs, that the drought in the neighbourhood of St. Croix river, the
                    present season, has been unusually severe, and that the fires in the woods
                    have raged to a more alarming extent than ever before known. Several buildings have been burnt at the parish of St.
                    Stephen's on the British side of the river, others were saved with a
                    great difficulty. From Calais to Eastport, about a fortnight since, the
                    vessel in which our informant took passage was entirely
                    enveloped in smoke.– In various places, the fires have been burning
                    for six weeks ; there had been no rain for eight weeks to wet the
                        ground.–Boston Paper.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of Chelmsford, dated New
                    Essex, Graham's Town, on the frontiers of Africa, June 21,
                    1821:–</p>
         <p>"I am seven hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and should not receive
                    intelligence of an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my correspondent at Cape Town will procure comfortable lodgings,
                    &amp;c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay, which is distant from me one
                    hundred and thirty miles.– Few ships from England proceed farther
                    than the Cape. Good ploughmen are wanted, and good footploughs, with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters, which are very
                    expensive here ; iron-work nothing under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell
                    for 14l. each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers, at from 2l. to
                    8l. per month and their board. Meat sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel
                    ; and barley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the
                    same price as in England ; but, on the other hand, we are in one of
                    the healthiest climates in the world, and free from rent, tithes, and taxes
                    of every description. Any one may live here as well with 500l.
                    as in his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] done
                    with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at 3l. each ; cows are 30s. ;
                    and sheep, 6s. a-head (having tails that weight 8lb., a complete
                    lump of fat) ; clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.–
                    Good mechanics, of any description, have very high wages. A cargo of
                    Ladies would make a good speculation, in proceeding to the New
                    Settlement ; for all that came out with the settlers have got
                    husbands."</p>
         <p>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, we understand that the Royal
                    African corps was disbanded there on the 26th of June last.</p>
         <p>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, we learn that the Governor, the
                    Honourable Mr. Elphinstone, has returned to the Presidency,
                    after a five months' tour to the northward. He must minutely examined
                    all the judicial and revenue systems–furnishing the
                    Collectors and Agents of Government with particular instructions
                    for their guidance. He also sent out strong detachments to reduce some
                    predatory hordes who have long plundered the country, and been a terror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are are
                    called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods, and descend in bands to
                    commit their depredations. By these letters we learn, what is essential for
                    young men going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets now
                    undergo an examination as to their knowledge of the native languages ; and
                    no youth has a chance of success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?].
                    The highest respect is entertained for the able manner in which the
                    disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young men for the services. We rejoice
                    to learn that the Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan.</p>
         <p>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account of a terrible earthquake
                    which took place on the 29th December last, on the south coast of Celebes.
                    It did immense damage, especially at Budekomba[?], where the sea rose
                    several times to a prodigious height, and then falling in with the
                    incredible rapidity, alternately deluged and left the shore, destroying all
                    the plantations from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred
                    have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] ba was much damaged,
                    that of Bontain less so. On the 4th of January this year, there was another
                    shock of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any damage. It is with much regret we lay before our readers the following details
                    of a most calamitous fire which broke out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the
                    17th ult. :</p>
         <p>"Halifax, Sept. 17. "The conflagration this
                    morning was one of the most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax.
                    It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occupied
                    by Shay and Milany, and before it was discovered, had gained an
                    alarming height. It was near two o'clock when the bells were rung. The
                    troops, seamean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon
                        assembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines
                    formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exertion
                    made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, that before any check
                    could be given to it, the whole block of buildings, with the exception of a
                    house situated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets,
                    occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses occupied by Mrs. Neilson and Mr
                    T. Muirhead, on Barrington street, and a stable belonging to J.
                    W. Johnston, Esq. in Granville-street, were consumed.</p>
         <p>"For some time great apprehensions were entertaintained that the
                    fire would extend to the houses on the opposite side of the
                    streets, but fortunately it did not. Of the property burnt only about t1500
                    were insured, and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long be
                    severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– upon
                    industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of worldly wealth was invested in
                    the tenements they occupied.</p>
         <p>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, the town is, as usual,
                    greatly indebted for the exertions made by them. Twenty-one houses were
                    consumed, with other valuable property."</p>
         <p>America appears to be very unhealthy just now– The accounts from Long
                    Island, Baltimore, Amelia Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous.
                    The whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one family being
                    well, and in many instances not one to assist another. So dreadful, indeed,
                    is the disease, that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New York
                    Paper of the 30th ult. says–</p>
         <p>We are sorry to perceive from the Franklin Gazette,
                    that the malignant fever continues to make serious ravages
                    among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four full victims to it in the 24
                    hours ending on Sunday morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday
                    morning.</p>

         <p>Colonial Intelligence</p>
         <p>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Gazettes, an account
                    of the dreadful drought which had prevailed in that island for more than
                    twelve months and the consequences of which had been most calamitous. We are now, however, most happy, in being able to
                    state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who left Jamaica some days
                    subsequently to the date of our preceding advices, that this terible evil,
                    in such a climate particularly, had at length ceased. The
                        following is the substance of the information which has been
                    communicated to us:–</p>
         <p>"A few hours previous to my going on board the Jamaica packet, on the 3d of
                    September, the rain fell in such torrents as to flood the streets of
                    Kingston to the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general
                    throughout the district of Liguanea.</p>
         <p>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the present, or, perhaps, the
                    ensuing year, this seasonable change of weather would at least have the
                    effect of staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those
                    interested in the island will receive the intelligence with
                    gratification. On some properties, the canes had been cut as fodder to save
                    the stock."</p>
         <p>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th August, and as
                    they are unusually barren in their contents, it is fair to infer
                    that every thing was proceeding there in a satisfactory manner. The only
                    article of the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor
                    is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing from it all the
                    base metal, and substituting gold and silver of standard value.</p>
         <p>The Gazette of Dordrecht publishes accounts from Java
                    to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of the decrease of the malady,
                    and mention, that it was almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang,
                    but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fallen
                    victims. Batavia and Sourabaya were still infected.</p>
         <p>India–Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated
                    June 20:–</p>
         <p>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with you as a means
                    suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease the difficulties of Old England,
                    which we read of here, we imagine that India can furnish beneficial
                    openings to this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British production and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the
                    English printed cottons are now carried in considerable quantities as
                    far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if they be of handsome patterns.
                    The warehouses now are so far from being overstocked, that before the
                    arrival of two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all European articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold
                    about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns the ld ; a
                    common round hat, three guineas. These, undoubtedly, were prices arising
                    from an unusual scarcity ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a
                    trading, which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggeration of price and profit. Government bonds are now at six
                    per cent premium, though they bear but half the usual or legal interest of
                    the country. This is a tolerable evidence of the credit of the Company and
                    the Government. There is a great and increasing prosperity in
                        Hindostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Provinces within these two years is surprising.</p>

         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>The following is an extract of a letter dated Louisville, August 12th, 1820,
                    from a Scotchman who has been ong settled in America, to his friend, a
                    Scotch Farmer, who rents 500 acres of land in the County of Middlesex.</p>
         <p>"The circumstances in which this country is placed at present are truly
                    melancholy, when compared to what they have been ; yet still it
                    is a better country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to make
                    money by farming, at present, in the United States, for the want of a
                    market; and I am of opinion that things will not mend, in this
                    respect, for some years, for all are sellers and none buyers. All
                    kinds of produce are selling, or rather offered for sale, at one-third
                    of what prices were two years ago. Land, of course, has fallen in the same
                    ratio. The best of cleared land, within from 5 to 10 miles of this
                    town, is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an acre. You will thence
                    conclude that this is a favourable time to purchase – and
                    that for a man who has a little money, and a large family able and
                    willing to labour with their hands, this is a most excellent country,
                    as he can easily raise on this cheap land all the necessaries, and many of
                    the luxuries, of life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver,
                    or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot be badly off with
                    more beef, mutton, pork and grain, than he can dispose of. He has no rent
                    to make up by term day: his taxes are next to nothing, and
                    although he may grumble to have to turn his pigs into his corn field to
                    save the expense of reaping it, or to see his apples rotting
                    under his trees by barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them,
                    yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those of the poor
                    farmers in our native land, and as I suppose in England. To the
                    wealthier farmer the change is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that
                    if he stays long in Britain he will soon become less wealthy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. He would miss
                    many things made necessary by habit; he would find his servants more lazy,
                    and less obedient ; and he would even experience pain because
                    the modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do here; but when he
                    gets over these things, he will find the advantage of the change. To say
                        nothing of the difference of the Government, and the satisfaction of chusing one's own rulers, there are many
                    desirable things here. I estimate, as the greatest, the ease of
                    providing for one's family. A man may, with very little exertion, leave to
                    all his children land enough to make them independent. Hence that
                    sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family is little known
                    here."</p>

         <p>
            <pb n="1"/>SOUTH AMERICA.Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, September 10, 1821.</p>
         <p>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town;
                    6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about
                    1200 Europeans, and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks
                    and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never
                    saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and miserty
                    than in any town of the size in the world.– There are some few
                    splendid houses, but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you
                    cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The
                    streets, as in all American towns, run at right angles; a
                    powerful stream of water in each : the town is capable of great
                    improvement. The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as
                    if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born
                    race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we
                    made the same observation; the ague very general, with
                    fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil: thin
                    clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a
                    heavy blanket, and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from
                    coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on
                    the whole not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living
                    in a rational way. Very few families cook at home–they buy
                    their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, and in the
                    squares: not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables: they
                    drink brandy at all hours, and excuse themselves for not having any thing
                    that is expensive, by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies
                        himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card
                    in the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, and dress;
                    every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady take no offence at her
                    frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite as good as her
                    neighbours, and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and
                    Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America: every
                    Viceroy, from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of
                    immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people
                    seems incredible–one must see to believe it : scarcely a young lady
                    can read or write, or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not
                    appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by
                    the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to
                    priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of Lima is
                    covered with churches, some of them very splendid. The whole
                    trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of
                    Pasco for returns : if this is worked to advantage, it will produce six
                    millions of produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true;
                    but this requires tranquility and good government. People
                    in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; every traveller and
                    historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to
                    stand in the pillory for a liar.</p>
         <p>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to Upper Peru, is a
                    wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and
                    Indians–placed on a sand bank–the pepole all in the
                    ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on
                    a bulsa, (two bladders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian.
                    We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetables for money. Their cultivation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to
                    fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twenty
                    hours, offering them any price for their tropical fruits.</p>
         <p>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on the ground;
                    borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery No such thing as a tavern :
                    never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at
                    eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable
                    ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the
                    chandlier; the house filled with smoke.</p>
         <p>"There are 82 titled familes, mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by
                    the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year, Peru will
                    be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians
                    will regain their empire, and exterminate all other colours. The
                    number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy
                    thousand– 25,000 in Lima and adjacent villages; the total population
                    of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.</p>
         <p>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses.
                    Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in the greatest variety; fruits of
                    all climates in the marketplace, the produce of the sea-shore
                    and the Cordillera.– Beef and mutton excellent–the chief
                    supplies come from Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore
                    produce is contiued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about
                    the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most
                    valuable land a league from the town, half cultivated and half abandoned;
                    every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never behald;
                    no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they
                    will not work, and famine must ensue. "</p>

         <p>Portsmouth, June 5.–This day the ship William Shand,</p>
         <p> Captain Kerr, arrived direct from Port Jackson, New South Wales, which
                    place she left on the 1st of February, not having touched any where, and
                    made her voyage round Cape Horn in four months and five days. She has a
                    full cargo of wool and sea oil ; the former principally the produce of the
                    flocks of Mr Macarther, and is much improved in fineness, in better
                    condition for market, and is altogether superior to the first
                    class of Spanish wool.–Trade was toletably brisk at all
                    our settlements in that quarter, and the crops had been productive.</p>

                    Wales. She took between three and four hundred culprits, who had been
                    sentenced for various crimes to transportation.</p>
         <p>Greenland Fishery.</p>
         <p>The Spencer, Keith, arrived at Montrose from the Greenland seats on Tuesday
                    last, with five small fish and one hundred and fifty seals, supposed to
                    boil fifty tuns of oil. Captain Keith and the crew describe the season as
                    very unfavourable. They saw many whales, but the high winds and great
                    quanities of ice rendered fishing in many instances impossible. There has
                    not been so much ice in Greenland for the last twenty years.</p>
         <p>The Gleaner, Shand, and Eclipse Sutter, the former with 13 fish, 70 tuns,
                    and the latter with 6 fish, 100 tuns, and the Jean, Stafford, with three
                    fish, 55 tuns, have arrived at Peterhead, from the Greenland whale
                    fishery.</p>
         <p>On Tuesday last, a whale fishing ship, supposed to belong to Hull, passed a
                    vessel belonging to Aberden, off Redhead, and broomed 9 fish.</p>

         <p>Deal,August 28–The
                    vessels belonging to the Corporation of the Trinity House have this morning
                    placed a buoy, with a staff and vane, near the Goodwin South Sand Head,
                    bearing by compass, from the south end of this town, south by east.</p>
         <p>Smyrna, July 17–His

                    Austrian brig of war, arrived here some days ago, with two
                    pirates, a schooner and a large tugsail boat. Another was destroyed by
                    her.</p>

         <p>Hunt.–It is understood that Hunt will be taken, in a short time, from Hertford
                    gaol, and put on board one of the hulks lying off Woolwich, preparatory to
                    his being transported for his natural life, by the first convict-ship,
                    which will sail from this country to New South Wales.</p>
         <p>The augmentation of the army consists in the formation of two regiments, the
                    94th and 95th infantry, and in the intended raising of four others, but
                    which will not be embodied for some time. If we look at the previous
                    strength of the army of this extended Empire, the small increase
                    in question will not only excite no alarm, but it will be considered
                    absolutely necessary for ordinary purposes. The total number of regulars
                    voted for the last year (exclusive of the East Indies) was only 71,000,
                    including officers. These may be said to be distributed in the following

      <text>
         <p>Prison Discipline.</p>
         <p>The Fifth Report of the Committee of the Society for
                    the Improvement of Prison Discipline, &amp;c.–1823. With an Appendix, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>This Report only
                    reached us yesterday ; but the Society brings so much
                    benevolence into activity, under the guidance of practical wisdom, aided by
                    very enlightened views of the best interests of society, that we consider
                    any delay improper in calling the attention of the public to their
                    valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds with evidence that they
                    have not relaxed in their exertions. At home, not only are the
                    laws improving, but the magistracy are carrying improvements into all the
                    practical departments. A great many jails, designed on much better principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the
                    country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, generally, that much more attentions is paid to
                    health, cleanliness, diet, employment, and classification. It
                    must not be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. There
                    are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, and chained to the
                    floor of their cels from night to morning ; others in which
                    persons committed for trial are fettered
                    with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; and others in which
                    debtors are exposed to the contaminating society of criminals,
                    in which neither the various classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are
                    kept separate from each other, and in which all are allowed to be idle.
                    The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a covered
                    vehicle for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the
                    metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of
                    inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely suspected
                    of crime, by marching them handcuffed through the
                    streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of one
                        hun-dred prisoners were marched for a mile handcuffedthrough the open streets, in order to be formally set at
                        liber-ty by proclamation ! So much for metropolitan
                    decorum ! These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however,
                    long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, through the
                    proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be enough to do them away ;
                    but while they are continued England should be somewhat chary of her
                    boasts. The views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting
                    notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Norway,
                    Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates have already resolved on
                    the erection of a new city gaol. In St Petersburgh the prisoners are now
                    furnished with food, clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies'
                        Association, under the patronage of the Princess Mesthersky, is also in full activity at St
                    Petersburgh ; and there is an auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very
                    frontiers of Siberia. Seven thousand prisoners passed through
                    Orel last year ; but their chains have been lightened, and their condition
                    meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian Society.
                    For details, however, we must refer to the Report itself ; but
                    we cannot take leave of it without making special notice of the benefits
                    conferred on society by the Female Associations and
                        Temporary Refuge. The almost miraculous power of
                    kindness, when accompanied, as genuine kindness often is, with quiet
                    feeling and unobtrusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in
                    the Ladies' Committee, of which Mrs Fry, we
                    believe, is still at the head. In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and
                    licentiousness, have been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and
                    the same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships in which
                    convicts are embarked for New South Wales. Arrangements are thus made for
                    the formation of schools for moral and religious instruction during the
                    voyage, and the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing
                    and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the manufacture
                    of such articles as may be readily sold for their relief on arriving at the
                    colony. These are truly good works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed
                    on the Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have been
                    established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, Derby, Dumfries,
                    Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Nottingham, Plymouth, York, and Glasgow. We had once thought that, by this time, we
                    might have added Edinburgh ; and we are inclined to
                    hope that the present Lord Provost will yet employ his influence
                    in establishing a Lady's Society for the prisons of our
                    Metropolis.– There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the
                    hope, of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of the Prison
                    Society is chiefly for affording relief to distressed boys, who,
                    on their discharge from the prisons of the metropolis, have expressed a
                    desire to abandon their criminal courses. Many of these are in
                    circumstances of urgent want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih
                        pleasure on many who are variously settled, and conducting them-selves exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are
                    trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and religious
                    duty, and after a time are provided with suitable situations." There is a
                    great similarity in the histories of the individuals admitted into this
                    asylum ; but the greater number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been
                    almost driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or
                    destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had fallen into
                    the company of professed thieves. The Committee mention that on
                    one recent occasion, no less than eightboys were released from Newgate in one day, and immediately
                    after they had undergone the sentence of flogging,which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into effect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus marked with
                    the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and want of strength, they are
                    disabled from working, at the very time they ought to go in search of
                    employment. No more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate
                    these boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence
                    their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to look upon
                    what they call a smart whipping as the only corrective
                    for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences to
                    which their system inevitably tends. We are decidedly,
                    and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, merely to
                    be felt as such. In the case of children, if not necessary for that purpose, it will certainly give them the idea
                    of power superior to their own, and may thus be the means of constraining
                    more readily than otherwise ; but the law, when it
                    inflicts pain, has always other means of evincing its power, and
                    constraining those who are within its grasp. Its most important function is
                    to prevent crime ;its next is o convince those who comit offences that the means of
                    detection are, on the whole, so sure that nothing is to be
                    gained by the commission ; and its next, to make restitution onerous and
                    complete. There may also be some classes of criminals who ought to be
                    considered and treated as mad–some are
                    curable ; and some as incurably furious, who must either be cut
                    off altogether, or confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction
                    of punishments, because in our opinion the most effectual
                    of those will be found to consist in the best means of preventing or
                    remedying the evils produced by crime. All exposures, restraints,
                    constraints, and compulsory reparations are punishments. We are
                    only hostile to the infliction of pain for no other purpose but
                    because pain is produced. If it can be made obvious
                    to the sufferers that the pain inflicted protects
                        others, or affords true reparation for the
                    wrongs done to them or society, we shall then grant that such punishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison
                    Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but firmly, from
                    the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind and irrational benevolence,
                    and advocated measures which went to raise the condition of prisoners above
                    that of common labourers, do still seem to us to have been too
                    much moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a clever
                    essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be somewhat too indulgent to
                    the advocates of hard labour and severe punishments. We are rather inclined
                    to think them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they
                    allow has been so worked or constructed at different places as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they very properly
                    insist that every tread-mill should be provided with " a
                    regulator," by which its rate of revolution may at all times be restrained
                    within safe limits, and a dial-register, (lately invented by Mr Bate, instrument maker to the Board of
                    Excise) by which the rate of labour may be, at any time, accurately
                    ascertained, and which ( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet
                    in ascent for one day. There is an able argument in the report against
                    compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned for trial : and there is a great mass of curious and
                    useful information in the Appendix.</p>

                    since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; and 300 to Bermuda ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or
                    transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ;
                    and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. The
                    health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct orderly.</p>
         <p>The Office-bearers of the Refuge for the Destitute have,
                    during the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed
                    to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to parents and friends, 214 individuals :–under their charge
                    at present 154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at
                    least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has
                    recommended a grant from Parliament.</p>
         <p>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying persons
                    possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains no regulations
                    for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning or making up of
                    those who are to serve on each jury. There does seem to be an improvement
                    on the form of the returns to be made by the
                    Constables to the Sheriffs.</p>

         <p>Scottish Intelligence.</p>
         <p>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling houses
                    have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of servants and
                    others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at night and put the burning
                    coals under the grate, not recollecting that, in the construction of almost
                    every house, the stone placed under the grate is supported by timber,
                    separated from the hearth stone by some lime only. The wood underneath
                    being once ignited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a
                    few hours involve the whole tenement in flames.</p>
         <p>Emigration to Australia.–We understand that the
                        establishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a
                        number of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a
                    society to aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle
                    in New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are
                    actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect.
                    On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry
                    Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in the
                    Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William Ellis, Esq. S. S.
                    C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the Commercial Bank. The principal
                    object comprehended in those were the security of the persons and property
                    of emigrants on the voyage–the maintenance of a regular
                    communication with friends left behind, and the insuring a friendly
                    welcome, temporary accommodation, and facilities for permanent
                    settlement in the country of their adoption. It was also proposed to give
                    assistance in money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying
                    the expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first
                    well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny.
                    Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm servants, and labourers, are the classes to which the
                    principles of the society specially apply.</p>
         <p>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk
                    trade, the amount of drawback to be allowed on silk that has paid the duty
                    will be between t300,000 and t400,000.</p>
         <p>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in Tobago Street, and
                    the Police were called, who, to make sure of the rioter, secured the door ;
                    at which a young woman, a servant, became so much alarmed, that she leaped
                    out of a window, situated on the third floor, whereby her back
                    was broken. She now lies very ill in the Royal Infirmary.</p>
         <p>The Army–The several Recruiting Parties
                    throughout Great Britain and Ireland having received their instructions,
                    are now actively employed in raising men for the three new Regiments of the Line, whose establishments, it is expected, will be
                    in a very short time completed. The Head-quarters of the 97th Regiment
                    are changedfrom Gosport to Winchester.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Mr Secretary Peel, in moving the commitment of the
                        Transportation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill
                    were, first, to continue the laws on transportation, that would expire
                    before the next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last
                    session a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment
                    of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending
                    convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to decide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it
                    was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transportation was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a
                    great different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled habits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to
                    whom, as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wished it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South
                    Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the settlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection
                    would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment
                    efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.–
                    He gave this statement because it was right the public should know
                    that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.</p>

         <p>Press at Cape of Good Hope</p>
         <p>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place between him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his journal, gives the following account of his interview with that
                        functionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger
                    to me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did
                    so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, The South African Commercial Advertiser, and said he was
                        instructed to inform me that I had departed from the
                    Prospectus – that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and
                    referred more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him
                    to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then
                    mentioned some leading remarks, which (he said) bore
                    upon the Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as "ob-noxious," all quotations which had been made from "
                    De Lolne[?], "Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work " Lacon," and, generally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press,
                    observing –" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and,
                    as we are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his
                        opinion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also,
                    that it was expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but
                    wait until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts
                    (such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to be
                    omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sureties, in
                    the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the offensive
                    nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; and, lastly, that
                    I was to take particular care, that the next number (18)
                    contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any notice of Mr
                    Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would give no promise as to
                    what would appear in the next or any future number. That I required time to
                    consider what was fitting to be done with regard to the security
                    demanded."</p>
         <p>The Morning Chronicle makes the following remarks on this
                    case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this description should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power
                    produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best
                    dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our conquered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately
                    quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments have
                    this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in office are
                    generally selected with some reference to abilities and acquirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Gonernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails
                    itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere
                    places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing
                    can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a
                    Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgraceful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies,
                    every person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be astonished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial
                    appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that is
                    said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal of a Cape
                    of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public what sort of personage
                    he is. Would it be believe, that in a country of boundless extent, with
                    only a settlement here and there, where the greatest enemies the Colonists
                    have to contend with, are the wild animals, it could possible enter in to
                    the head of any rarional being to introduce laws for the
                    preservation of game. One would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for
                    the preservation of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would
                    do credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible
                    disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the Cape
                    Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on this personage
                    would be thrown away.</p>

                    happy to learn that the important branch of trade fully keeps pace
                    with the increasing prosperity of the country. The general orders for
                    metal are represented to be equal to some of those brisk periods of demand
                    which so frequently occurred during the late war, when a much heavier price
                    was readily realized han it now bears.–Sheffield Iris.</p>

         <p>Wesleyan Methodist Missions.–The twelfth
                        anniversary of the Methodist Missionary Society for the
                    Leeds District, commenced in Brunswick Chapel, on Monday forenoon. Mr
                    James Musgrave was called to the chair. The Rev. Valentine Ward, on the
                        Secretaries to the Society read the report, from which it
                    appears that in Ireland, the Society has 21 missionaries : in France,
                    Gibraltar, and Malta, eight missionaries, and 230 members ; in Ceylon and
                    Continental India, 27 missionaries, 511 members ; New South Wales, Van
                    Dieman's Land, New Zealand, and Tongataboo, 10 missionaires, 142 members ;
                    Western and Southern Africa, 16 missionaries, 1109 members ;
                    Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, 18 missionaries, 2134 members, exclusive of
                    upwards of 20 missionaries whom the Committee have resolved to send
                    out as soon as possible. The regular hearers of the missionaries are
                    two-thirds more than the members, and there are 12,000 children educated in

         <p>New South Wales.–As a proof of the increasing
                    trade betwixt Leith and New South Wales, it may be mentioned that the
                    Australian Company have chartered a fine new brig the Mary of Alloa, about
                    300 tons register, in addition to their regular traders, which
                        vessel sailed from the Road on Saturday afternoon, at
                    three o'clock for that colony, with a full general cargo, and a number
                    of passengers. Another vessel, the Margaret, a brig, also about 300 tons,
                    is now loading for the same place, chartered by a merchant in
                    Leith.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Love in a Prison.–We have all heard that "Love
                    rules the court, the camp, the grove" but we have rarely heard that
                    the little god delighted to dwell in prisoned solitude ; true it is and of
                    verity, nevertheless, that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in,
                    at least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not long
                    since a couple, who had imbided the tender passion, were linked
                    in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and a like consumnation, most devoutly to
                    be wished for by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken
                    place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a petition has
                    been presented by two delinquents of different sexes, both under
                    sentence of transportation, to the Magistrates, praying that they may be
                    allowed to marry before setting out for New South Wales. The fond pair
                    never saw each other till inclosed in the same vehicle on their way to
                    stand trial at last Perth Circuit, for capital offences ; yet, in this
                    situation, love–omnipotent love–took the captives
                    captive, and rendered them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight,
                    "o'er a' the ills o' life victorious." But, alas! " the course of true
                    love never did run smooth;" and no less a personage than the Secretary of
                    State for the Home Department has in this case crossed the path of the
                        hapless couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for
                    many a year, by ordering the "fair penitent" to be removed
                    to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, instead of transportation for
                    fourteen ; leaving the forlorn lover to seek consolation in the
                    charms of some sterling or currency damsel in the land of promise, to which he must now wend
                    his solitary way.–Fife Hld.</p>

      <text>
         <p>House of Commons.–June 19.</p>
         <p>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before four o'clock, and was
                    shortly afterwards summoned by the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend
                    the House of Lords.</p>
         <p>The Speaker stated, on his return, that the Royal
                    Assent had been given by Commission to several public and private
                    bills.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Dundas presented a petition from Newbury, in
                    the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of slavery in the
                    West Indies.</p>
         <p>Mr Planta moved for a new writ for the election of
                    a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord Leveson Gower,
                    who had accepted the office of Chief Secretary for
                    Ireland.–Ordered.</p>
         <p>Ale-House Licensing Bill.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Estcourt, the house resolved
                    itself into a committee on this bill.</p>
         <p>On the clause that no brewer who should himself supply public
                    houses with beer, should be allowed to act or assist as a Magistrate at any
                    meeting or session for the granting of licenses,</p>
         <p>Mr Bernal moved that this clause be struck out
                    altogether.</p>
         <p>Mr R. Gordon supported the clause.</p>
         <p>Mr Monck thought this the most valuable clause in
                    the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a salutary
                    interference with the jurisdiction of borough magistrates.</p>
         <p>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the committee divided,
                    when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– Majority against the
                    clause 7.</p>
         <p>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then agreed to, amongst which
                    was the omission of the words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of
                    places from the operation of the bill. On the clause being proposed relative to the hours during which public
                    houses should be kept open on Sundays.</p>
         <p>Mr Estcourt said, the original clause was to the
                    effect that public-houses should be closed during the hours of morning
                    and afternoon's divine service, but he thought it would be better not to
                    permit publicans to allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after
                    the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service (one o'clock.)</p>
         <p>After a conversation, in which several hon. members participated, the clause
                    was agreed to.</p>
         <p>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed to, the house resumed
                    ; the report was brought up, ordered to be taken into further
                    consideration on Monday next, and printed.</p>
         <p>The Usury Laws.</p>
         <p>Mr P. Thompson moved the second reading of the
                    usury laws amendment bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Davenport said he should oppose the bill, as he
                    considered it to be highly injurious both to the landed and
                    commercial interests. The hon. members moved an amendment, that the bill be
                    read a second time that day three months.</p>
         <p>The question on th amendment having been put,</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested the propriety of postponing this bill until
                    the next session of parliament. He made this suggestion from no
                    unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because this was not,
                    he conceived, the most convenient time to consider it. The subject ought to
                    be fully considered, with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without
                        interfering with long-continued prejudices. If the discussion were postponed he would give the subject the best
                    attention in his, (hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr Heathcote approved of the suggestion of the
                    right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the question to be
                    postponed till the next session of parliament.</p>
         <p>Mr  L. Foster thought that, between the total repeal,
                    or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their present shape,
                    a middle course might be steered. Of the bill before the house he thought
                    that, under the guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the greatest illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the country, for he was convinced that it would effect as complete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as
                    could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to consider the
                    probable operation of that repeal upon all the great interest of the
                    country. The bill might give relief to few, but would bring injury to
                    many.</p>
         <p>Lord Palmerston thought the house indebted to the
                    hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It might be possible to
                    form a bill better than that of the hon. member, but his bill was better
                    than the present law, and as such he should vote for it.</p>
         <p>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, when there appeared for
                    the second reading,–Ayes, 52; Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the
                    second reading, 12.</p>
         <p>Voters' Registration Bill.</p>
         <p>Lord Nugent moved the second reading of the
                    voters' registration bill, and said that his object in carrying it through the present stage was, that the bill might be committed
                        pro forma, for the purpose of having
                    certain amendment introduced into it. It would then be printed with its
                    amendments, in order that the house and the country might have the
                    opportunity of considering its details between this and the next session
                    of Parliament.</p>
         <p>Sir R. Wilson moved, as an amendment, that the
                    bill might be read a second time that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr H. Gurney seconded the amendment.</p>
         <p>The question was then put on the amendment, which was agreed to, and the
                    bill was ordered to be read a second time this day six
                    months.</p>
         <p>Salmon Fisheries Preservation Bill.</p>
         <p>On the motion of the Chancellor of Exche-quer, the house resolved itself into a committee
                    on the salmon fisheries preservation bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Ferguson proposed the insertion of a clause,
                    exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon fisheries in the
                    River and Bay of Thurso, in the county of Caithness, which are the
                    exclusive property of Sir John Sinclair.</p>
         <p>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and the committee divided,
                    when the clause was lost.</p>
         <p>The bill having passed through the committee, the report was ordered to be
                    received this day.</p>
         <p>The other orders were then disposed of, and the house adjourned at half-past
                    two o'clock.</p>
         <p>Friday,June 20.</p>
         <p>Sir G. Murray took the oaths and his seat, on his
                    re-election for the county of Perth.</p>
         <p>A number of petitions were presented against the continuance of Negreo
                    Slavery.</p>
         <p>Irish Currency.</p>
         <p>Sir G. Hill presented a petition from the Chamber
                    of Commerce of the city of Londonderry, praying that the bill for
                    amending the laws relating to Banks in Ireland might not be
                    allowed to make further progress for the present. The petition was laid on
                    the table.</p>
         <p>Sir A. Chichester presented a petition from Belfast, praying a reduction of the duty on coals in Ireland, which was laid upon the table.</p>
         <p>Scotch Gaols' Bill.</p>
         <p>The Lord Advocate, in moving that this bill be
                    read a second time and printed, observed, that it was not his
                    intention to press it further during the present Session. No man could,
                    however, deny that the object of the Bill was of great importance, and he
                    proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made generally known
                    throughout the country, in order that it might be again presented to the
                    house in as perfect a shape as possible.</p>
         <p>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to be printed.</p>
         <p>Committee of Supply.</p>
         <p>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of minor
                    importance were agreed to.</p>
         <p>Sir H. Hardinge said, he had another resolution to
                    propose, but it was in which he expected that a reduction
                    would be made next year. It was, that a sum of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted
                    for the expenses of the disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.</p>
         <p>Mr Spring Rice said, that within the last twelve
                    years there had been two millions and a half expended on this body,
                    and that the subject was one which few gentlemen took the trouble to look
                    at. He begged to say a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the
                    staff, which was larger than that of England, was without a
                    private man. Nothing could a more outrageous job than that of
                    the milita in Ireland. The colonels kept the whole patronage of
                    the regiment, and kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and
                    friends. The militia might have been of service at one time in Ireland
                    ; but since that time the present effective police had been
                    established, and quite superseded it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer
                    this to remain if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if
                    not abolish it.</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer begged to assure his hon. friend that he wanted no
                    prompting to make any economical reduction. When, however, a plan for
                    the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was in contemplation, it would
                    be laid before Parliament, and he should then be the friend of the definite
                    and limited powers to which he had alluded.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume said, the militia had been defended as
                    though the country were in hourly danger of invasion –as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that were so,
                    he would gladly learn of what use were the spies, who cost us L450,000
                    a-year. We had ambassadors–they were very little better
                    than spies–at an expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious
                        observance were not sufficient to save the country from
                    sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he certainly
                    knew no other advantage which ambassadors and consuls could be of.</p>
         <p>New South Wales Bill–Committee.</p>
         <p>On the order of the day having been read for the house resolving itself into
                    committee on the New South Wales bill.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson moved that the Speaker do leave the
                    chair.</p>
         <p>Sir J. Mackintosh said, the object of his present
                    motion, of which he had previously given notice, was, to propose two
                    instruction to the committee on the bill which the right hon. gentleman (Mr
                    Huskisson) had introduced–first, to the effect that the committee
                    should recommend the introduction of a clause for the establishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land;
                    and secondly, that it should recommend that a clause be
                    introduced, providing for the election of one-third of the Legislative
                    Council from among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and
                    having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] of three
                    years. The best local authories in favour of his proposition.
                    Among these he might mention the names of Governor Hunter,
                    Governor Bligh, Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, and
                    his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone out to the colony
                    prejudiced against the introduction into it of these
                    institutions ; but, after two years careful investigation of the subject,
                    wrote home in Oct. 1825, stating, that there was now no longer any doubt
                    about its perfect ripeness for them.–(Hear,
                        hear.)–The partial introduction of English institutions into immediate
                    practise was the only pledge of a real intention on the part of
                    government to introduce them more completely in the end. The right hon.
                    gent. concluded by moving that instruction be given to the committee
                    to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the colony, and to
                    allow the inhabitants a voice in the legislative councils.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson said, in the bill which he had introduced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the
                    government of the country of granting trial by jury in all civil
                    cases. His right hon. friend would find, if he examined, that the
                    foundation would be laid of granting the inhabitants of that
                    colony a share in managing their own concerns. At present the legislature
                        proposed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative
                        committee for the purpose of watching and controuling
                    every measure of the state. All trials should be public, under the
                    inspection of a free press, and a population jealous of their rights. They
                    should now be prepared in the course of a few years for the regular
                        introduction of a legislative assembly ; not had he any
                    fears when such a change should take place, that it would lead to any
                    political convulsion.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume had every reason to believe, that if, instead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would
                    introduce a portion of representation and the privileges of British
                    subjects into New South Wales, it would be the most flourishing of the
                    colonies.</p>
         <p>Mr Horace Twiss said, the knowledge of one fact
                    might obviate the necessity for one at least of the right hon. gent.'s
                    propsitions, namely, that the governor of the colony had the
                    power of extending to the colonists the right of trial by jury
                    if he should deem it expedient.</p>
         <p>Sir James Mackintosh here intimated that he should
                    not press his amendments. They were accordingly negatived.</p>
         <p>The house then resolved itself into the Committee when several verbal
                    amendments were proposed and agreed to.</p>
         <p>The bill then went through the committee, and the report, with the
                    amendments, was ordered to be brought up on Monday.</p>
         <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and the house adjourned
                    at half-past two o'clock.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Bervic.–There has been raised this season on
                    the high lands of the farm of Hallgreen, belonging to Mr Blair, a few
                    acres of Rib-grass, a native plant of New South
                    Wales. It was imported to this country two years ago by a man who had
                    served his time in Van Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be
                    high land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it appears
                    not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed with which it comes in
                    contact. It is said to be the best plant in the world both for feeding
                    cattle, and for producing mik from cows, of the best and richest quality. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland
                    country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, we would soon
                    see their hills covering with a truly useful plant, instead of the useless
                    heath, with at present, even at best, only adorns them.</p>

         <p>House of Commons.–June
                        4</p>
         <p>Sir J. Mackintosh presented a petition from Mr
                    Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres were allowed to
                    perform dramatic pieces without the knowledge or leave of the writer, and
                    without any profit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron
                    and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that every person who
                    had given that subject consideration admitted that literary property was
                    not sufficiently protected in this country, and that the decline
                    of dramatic writing was to be attributed to the state of the law.</p>
         <p>Mr G. Lamb thought it a very serious grievance that
                    if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any manager,
                    and performed on the stage, and the writer brought to the miserable
                    condition of a damned author nolens volenns. (A laugh.) The decline of
                    dramatic writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unprofitable nature of that description of writing, as compared with other branches of literature ; and it would be very
                    desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his play like any other
                    description of property, and that no manager should perform it without
                    paying the writer, which was the system in France.</p>
         <p>The petition was ordered to be printed.</p>
         <p>Birmingham Petition.</p>
         <p>Mr Brougham rose to present a petition from a very
                    respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous meeting of
                    manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabitants of Birmingham,
                    and was signed by 8000 persons without solicitation. they contended that
                    the distress which now prevailed, not only had reference to that
                    poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole system of
                    society. This distress the petitioners ascribed to the tampering
                    that had taken place with the currency. Their opinion was, that
                    too much stress was laid upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ;
                    for, though it was true that a great number of failures had taken
                    place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, that of about 70 bankers
                    who had failed, as many as 80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If
                    such were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion of the
                    petitioners rather was, that the present distress arose from the
                    speculations and over-trading which had taken place ; and that such might
                    have been the case topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a
                    great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from the
                    depreciation of the currency, by which people were now paying taxes at a
                    rate that had never been intended when they were originally
                    imposed, was extremely likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that
                    the petitioners described was another question. In the year 1819 he
                    had been one of those who had resisted the imposition of new
                    taxes, because he thought that that was the very worst time that Ministers
                    could have chosen for such an object. His opinion, however, had been
                    over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That the effect of this
                    must be to cripple the industry of the country no man could doubt ; and
                    what he wished was to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that
                    after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing salaries,
                    and dealing in the best possible way with all the payments which the nation
                    had to make–the Dead Weight would still remain round the neck of the
                        country, and press it down to the effectual injury of its
                    best interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions of debt,
                    and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually payable thereon? In the
                    latter part of the petition he entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing
                    would be done to give the people as great relief from the pressure of the taxes
                    as might be consistent with a due regard to the public credit, and the
                    service of the State ; and so far from treating this remedy lightly, the
                    more he thought that the petitioners were wrong in their observations on the tampering of the currency, the more he was
                    inclined to listen to that part of the petition which appeared to him to be
                    founded on truth.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett was of opinion that the forced restoration of a metallic currency was one of the principal
                    causes of the present distress. The taxes were now paid in money, and
                    it now required twice the produce to pay them which it did before the year
                    1819. That was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be
                    remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would never break faith
                    with the public creditor, and the only means to pay off our public debt
                    would be to impose an income tax. If the public debt were once removed,
                    then free trade could take place in every branch of trade, but not
                    till then. Such was the opinion of his late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner
                    or later he thought some such measure would be resorted to.</p>
         <p>Mr Alderman Waitham observed that it was strange
                    that while the public distress was admitted to be extreme, no effort was
                    made to reduce the public expenditure. He was ready to prove
                    that the export trade of the country had fallen off to the amount of from
                    nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that in saying this
                    he was encountering serious adversaries. He did not under-rate our export
                    trade ; it was valuable but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen
                    off at the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be shewn
                    from Parliamentary documents. With respect to the petition now before the
                    house, he mainly agreed with its statements, while at the same time he
                    could never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with the
                    public creditor.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Whitmore heard with astonishment that our
                    foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse being so notoriously the
                    fact. Since 1814 there was certainly a fall in the value of our
                    manufactures, but so there was in the raw material, and the vast increase
                    of machinery should also be taken into account. It was said that our
                    exports had declined, but facts would prove decidedly the reverse. From
                    1790 to 1799, the exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809,
                    L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from 1821 to 1826,
                    L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and in 1828 the amounts of exports
                    rose to L52,000,000– So much for the alleged decrease of our export
                    trade, as stated by the worthy Alderman, (hear, hear,
                        hear.) In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of
                        depreciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much,
                    and he was induced to offer a word in order to counteract
                    the danger which might arise if the statements of the worthy Alderman
                    remained unanswered.</p>
         <p>Mr Sec. Peel observed, that, whenever any change,
                    however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made in the system
                    of our currency, it must be attended in the first instance with
                    considerable inconveniences. The more he considered the subject, the more
                    was he convinced that the best interests of the nation required that
                    we should strictly adhere to the law of our currency now
                    established. (Hear, hear.) He hoped he should never
                    see the time when the restrictions on cash payments should be renewed.
                    When, however, the petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the
                    amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would ask them what
                    they would, in that case, do with the Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the
                    gold would go out of the country. What would they do? They must renew
                    the restriction on cash payments by the Bank. It was not any change in the
                    value of the currency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had
                        occasioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the
                    number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and they were
                    assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in 1823 they were 56, assessed at
                    L18,293 ; in 1826, when the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72,
                        assessed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small
                    notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they were assessed at
                    L25,245. The hon. gentleman opposite had said that no fresh
                    capital had been employed in this trade, but that persons would work at a
                    loss rather than let their machines stand idle. But if this
                    were the case, it would not account for the erection of 12 new
                    factories, the establishment of which was irreconcileable with
                    the idea of general stagnation. With respect to the silk trade in
                    Manchester, in 1823 there were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ;
                    and there were between 3 and 4000 looms working manufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had had a letter from
                    Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon which he could rely, and it stated that
                    all the silk weavers were, or might be, in active emply. For the
                    last ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in powers of
                    production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per annum. Few persons
                    had attributed enough to the importation of labourers from
                    Ireland. A greater number of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts
                    were out of emply than people could imagine, and the Magistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their parishes,
                    reflecting that as they had contributed to the prosperity ot the places,
                    they had a right to relief when in distress. Where the passage was so low,
                    and this country possessed the advantage of a legal provision for the
                    poor, it was impossible to check the influx of Irish labourers, and this
                    fact would suggest important alterations in the state of the law. (Hear, hear.) He felt convinced that any alterations
                    with respect to the values of the currency would be attended with the
                        greatest evils to every class.</p>
         <p>Mr  W. Horton observed, that some honourable
                    gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and manufacturers to
                    arise from the state of the currency ; but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to
                    see how the redundant labour at Shipley could have been affected
                    by the change of the currency. Another class were the antipodes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn laws. But it
                    was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; we should look to practical
                    remedies. As long as a redundancy of labour existed in England,
                    which was aggravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked
                    to England, and operated a still further prejudice to the labouring
                    class of this country, the distress would continue. The remedy
                    which he proposed for the evil he had pointed out was emigration, in the
                    manner proposed in the report of a committee of which he had the
                        honour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum
                    of money to locate pauper labourers in our North American
                    colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read opinions in approbation of his
                    plan, from Mr Tooke, Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to the
                    same effect, in a lette which had been published. He then entered into a
                    calculation, to show the saving to parishes by this plan, and he challenged
                    any member of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.–
                    There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was constantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up immediately." This was a delicate subject to touch upon, for he knew not
                    how the vacuum could be filled up but by the introduction of
                    young gentlemen and ladies. (A laugh.) But was it
                    supposed that fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty
                    children? Or did these objectors suppose that labourers
                    would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The right honourable gentleman
                    then adverted to the remarks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was
                    stated that is appeared from the official documents that the mortality amongst the emigrants to North America had been in the
                    unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, whereas, in Wales, the
                    proportion was 1 in 69, and in England, 1 in 57. This, he would
                    assert, was an incorrect statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in
                    14, it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed in
                    Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emigrants, it
                    should be recollected, carried out children, and the mortality amongst
                    children was in the proportion of 1 in 12, and in London much
                    greater ; for it had been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the
                    poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The right hon.
                    gentleman concluded with reading his last resolution–" That it is
                    expedient that such measures should be adopted in the next Session of
                    Parliament as may furnish the most safe and effectual means of producing the desird improvement, by a judicious application of both these principles, and at the same time under
                    conditions which will prevent the probability of a recurrence of similar
                    evils, and also effect a material saving of the national income, instead of
                    producing an increased charge thereon."</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson contended that colonization ought to
                    be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, this country could never
                    have reached its present state of importance and prosperity, nor would our
                    language have been extended to the United States, and been adopted in
                    more distant countries. If there were one circumstance more striking than
                    another, it was the prodigious increase of consumption, a proof
                    of the growing wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814,
                    the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in our favour. This
                    country would carry on its great affairs with as small a portion of
                    metallic currency as possible, but let them guard against a
                    system which had led to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which
                    was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a metaphor
                    respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it rose with splendour, but
                    lost its brightness, and when its fire was extinguished it fell in
                    darkness, like the shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had
                    raised it.</p>
         <p>Mr Secretary Peel said, in consequence of the
                    course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to adopt in the
                    previous Session, a series of unfounded calumnies had been
                    levelled at him, which, however, he had despised too much to condescend to
                    notice. But there was one which, as it reflected on his public and
                    official character, he would, with permission of the house, allude to
                    on that occasion. The report to which he alluded was, that he had used his
                    influence as Secretary of State to procure an enormous grant of
                    land for a relative of his. (Hear, hear, hear.) In
                        consequence of seeing this report in the public newspapers,
                    he had requested his right honourable friend to move in that house,
                    for the production of certain papers calculted to explain the
                    whole matter. Those papers had in consequence been produced, and were now
                    printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would excuse him for
                    again alluding to the subject. (Hear,hear, hear.) He hoped that the consequence of those
                    papers being printed would have been, that some member
                    would have asked some questions on the subject ; but though this was not
                    the case, he had received a communication which made him think that some
                    one out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, though no
                    member of that house had been so deceived, (cheering.) He begged in the first place, to state most distinctly
                    that he had procured no grant of land for any brother of his, (hear) A gentleman, whose name was the same as his,
                    and who was his second cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon.
                    friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the house, upon his
                    word of honour, as a gentleman, he had had no participation whatever, (hear.) With respect to the settlement on the Swan
                    River, he was ashamed to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till
                    he received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him that he had
                    abandoned the idea of going to New South Wales ; and that from the
                    circumstances of Mr Twiss informing him that government would be
                    disposed to afford assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he
                    and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in a proposal to
                    that effect. With respect to the other calumnies which had been promulgated
                    against him, they rather went to private matters, and he had therefore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one had
                    reference to the public department in which he officiated, he
                    had thought it so far a public concern, as to venture to ask the attention
                    of the house while he trespassed on it to disclaim any
                    participation in the grant that had been made, (hear.)</p>
         <p>Sir Geo. Murray–The house would probably
                    think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, that it
                    would be unnecessary for him to rise to address them, (hear.) He was satisfied that the house knew that his right hon.
                    friend was incapable of proposing anything that would come under the
                    designation of what was vulgarly called a job, (hear.)</p>

         <p>Mr Secretary Peel gave notice that he should tomorrow move the adjournment of the house to that day week.
                    The right hon. gentleman at the same time presented a petition from the
                    Apothecaries Company of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill
                        regarding dissection.</p>
         <p>Mr Wilmot Horton rose to propose the resolutions of wich he had given notic relative to the state of
                    the labouring poor.</p>
         <p>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,</p>
         <p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved as an amendment that the order of the day be now
                    read.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett opposed the resolutions.</p>
         <p>The amendement was agreed to without a division.</p>
         <p>Mr Labouchere postponed until to-morrow his motion
                    respecting Canada.</p>
         <p>Slave Trade.</p>
         <p>Mr Otway Cave moved the following resolutions:</p>
         <p>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any lawful power to abridge or
                    destroy the natural rights of life and liberty, unless the owner shall
                    himself commit some criminal act that amounts to a
                    forfeiture.</p>
         <p>"2d, That although neither the government nor the legislature of the county
                    have arrogated to themselves the power of destroying the natural
                    rights of innocent British subjects, or of delegating any such power
                    to other authorities, it is a notorious fact, that in many British Colonies
                    lying remote from the immediate observation of the Government,
                    innocent British born subjects are, from the time of their birth,
                    robbed of their natural rights, and converted into slaves.</p>
         <p>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the Representatives of
                    the people, to take effectual measures for protecting all British subjects
                    that shall be born henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from similar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount
                    rights as human beings."</p>
         <p>The motion being seconded by Mr Lumley,</p>
         <p>Mr W. Smith said, he could not give his support to
                    these resolutions, because they were connected with a question of too
                    much importance to be agitated in such a manner, and at such a period of
                    the Session.</p>
         <p>Mr Huskisson was of opinion that resolutions of
                    such a description as those brought forward by the hon. member, ought
                    to be met by a direct negative.</p>
         <p>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The resolutions were
                    declared to be negatived without a division.</p>
         <p>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and the house adjourned
                    at half-past one o'clock.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Swan River.–The fine ship Gilmore, purchased by Mr T. Peel, brother to the Secretary of
                    State for the Home Department, proceeded down the river on Saturday, on her voyage to Swan River. The Gilmorequitted the St Catherine Docks in the course of Friday, having on
                    board an excellent assortment of every requisite which may be
                    required to form the new settlement. Mr Thomas Peel has had the
                        Gilmore, which is of 500 tons burthen, under his
                    own inspection, as well as the selection of the agricultural and other
                        implements to convey to the Swan River. There were many
                    passengers on board. Mr Peel and his family, it is understood will
                    join the vessel at Plymouth. In the vessel there are also going out other
                    settlers. The Hooghly, another ship of 500 tons
                    burthen, chartered by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her
                    voyage. Among the valuables sent out to Swan River are some fine
                    race-horses, intended for breeding in the settlement, from whence India
                    will be supplied, should the settlement answer.–Sunday Times.</p>

         <p>The King.–We are happy to learn from a private
                    source of unquestionable authenticity, that the King has seldom, if
                    ever, in his whole life, enjoyed better health than at the present moment.
                    From the same quarter we have received a confirmation of what we
                    mentioned some time back, that according to the present arrangements
                    of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's intetion to visit Brighton
                    before the expiration of the year.–Brighton
                        Gazette.</p>
         <p>The Revenne.–Ever since the beginning of the
                        quarter, symptoms of progressive improvement have manifested themselves in the revenue. Of late they have assumed
                    a more decided and promising character, and if the seven weeks that remain
                    prove as productive as the first month has been, not only will thre be no
                    falling off at the close, but a considerable increase may confidently be anticipated. We understand that the general
                    return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of London, for the
                    month o July last, amounts to one million one hundred and ten thousand
                    pounds. The returns from the out-ports have not all yet been
                    received, but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will
                    amount to above one million sterling.–Courier.</p>
         <p>It is certainly true that Laurent made an offer of L8000 a year for Covent
                    Garden ; but when asked to put his offer into writing, he withdrew, and
                    nothing more has been heard of it.–Court
                        Journal.</p>
         <p>The new musical entertainment forthcoming at the English Opera House, to be
                    called The Spring Lock,is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian novelist
                    (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include the romatic and eventful
                    interest of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. Peake is the accredited
                    author–Keeley is to be the hero, and Wood the principal vocalist ;
                    G. H. Rodwell is the composer.</p>
         <p>It is stated in a recent French paper, that during the last eight months not
                    fewer than twenty political and literary journals have been started in the
                    French provinces.</p>
         <p>It is stated in a French newspaper than an inhabitant of Lyon grafted upon
                    the same stem red and white grapes, and peaches, and apricots, which all
                    flowered at the same time, and gave ripe fruit with a few days of each
                    other.</p>
         <p>A carriage, containing 60 persons, was this day seen to traverse Paris. It
                    was drawn by six horses, merely by way of trial. This carriage and several
                        similat ones are building in the square of St Salpier. They
                    are to run between Paris and Lyons.–Paris
                        Paper.</p>
         <p>Steam Navigation.–Information has reached the
                    India House, that the East India Company's steam vessel
                    Enterprise will leave Bombay on the 15th of November next, for
                    Suez, where she may be expected to arrive early in December. Another
                    steam-vessel is to leave Bombay for the same destination in January next.
                    A communication by steam between this country and the Mediterrarean
                    has already been opened, and might, we suppose, be easily extended to
                    Egpyt. The expense of such a speculation would probably be amply compensated by the profit of conveying by so desirable a route
                    passengers to and from the East Indies.</p>
         <p>His Majesy the King of Prussia has honoured Mr by presenting him with a
                    splendid gold snuffbox, as a token of his Majesty's approbation
                    of Belshazzar's Feast." the "Dalage."&amp;c. Swan River.–That beautiful ship, the Gilmour,
                    sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She has upwards of 200
                    passengers on board, the whole of whom are highly respectable, and many of
                    them are in opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside
                    (accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got under weigh, the
                    passengers and crew gave him three cheers, and his reception altogether was
                    of the most gratifying description. The property on board the Gilmore
                    alone amounts to the more than L60,000. We understand also, that the
                    Minstrel will call at this port in about a fortnight to take out other
                    settlers on account of Mr Peel. We are informed that Government
                    have increased Mr Peel's grant of land from 350,000 to 1,000,000
                        acres.–Plymouth Journal.</p>
         <p>Gurney's Steam Carriage.–Yesterday afternoon Mr
                    Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request of the Duke of
                    Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack yard, before his Grave, the Ladies
                    Percy, Dance, and Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Thomas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, QuarterMaster General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, and a large number
                    of military and scientific gentlemen. His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies
                    Percy, &amp;c. had a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the
                    greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a waggon was
                    fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 soldiers besides Mr Gurney and
                    two or three men on the engine, and though the road was very disadvantageous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew them
                    round without the least diminuition of its speed, between nine and ten
                    miles an hour. In these experiments Mr Gurney applied his steam
                    generally but to one wheel in order to give the company full proof of
                    the power and practicability of the invention. Having satisfied them
                    as to this, and as to its manageability, by a variety of involutions and
                    evolutions, he gave them a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight
                    times round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is difficult to
                    say whether the company was more pleased or surprised at these unequivocal
                    proofs of Mr Gurney's success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it
                    was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should derive from
                    the introduction of such an invention as this.</p>
         <p>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Emperor Nicholas was
                    preparing to make a new levy at the rate of 4 upon every 500 male
                    individuals, which would give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said,
                    however, to have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should have
                    ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected the terms of peace which
                    he had proposed. On the other hand, we are told that the Sultan has
                    rejected those terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained
                    by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances of a desperate
                    struggle rather than submit to conditions which he deemed insulting.</p>
         <p>The English Bench.–There are two vacancies at
                    present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the death of
                    Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more recent decease of Mr Charles
                    Warren, Chief Justice of Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford
                    Square, on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. Mr
                    Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the former ; and the
                    choise, we supposem will be generally deemed to be a proper one. With
                    respect to the Chief Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the Sun, very properly recalls to public recollection
                    the fact, that "the Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended in
                    their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships altogether;" and adds
                    an opinion, in which we perfectly coincide, tht " the present
                    seems a fair opportunity for carrying the recommendation into
                    effect." Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one for
                    reducing public expences, when public burdens are oppressive.</p>
         <p>Platina Coin.–We have seen a specimen of the
                    new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the size of a shilling,
                    but heavier than a sovereign, and of three roubles value. On one side are
                    the Russian eagle and imperial arms; on the other the value of the coin,
                    and date–Globe.</p>
         <p>Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.–The spouses of the
                    living British poets are well known to be among the plainest of the sect, as Mr Slinslop
                    would say.–is wedded to the head of a gorgon, –
                    – is not much better off, – – has eloped from his
                    mate. We might run through the whole catalogue, without discovering a
                    handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers in descriptions
                    of female beauty. The truth is, that the contemplation of a bottle or
                    peaked nose, a wide mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author
                    to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal of womanly
                    perfections, and affords the widest scope to the imagination. Nothing
                    impedes the fancy more domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and
                        divine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes
                    the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to describe
                    what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not copied from Mrs Milton
                    grilling his dinner at the kitchen fire–but from some
                    unattainable damsel of his fancy. Plurality of women is only
                    allowed to a poet– one lawful, plain, household wife–and as
                    many airy mistresses as he can embody.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Swan River.–The ship Warrior, Stone,
                        commander, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies,
                    sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, with prospects
                    of favourable weather in her progress down the Channel. The Warrior is a
                    fine vessel of about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250
                    passengers to the new settlement. Several of the passengers
                    are persons of independent fortune, who have embarked considerable property
                    in the speculation ; and and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the
                    enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation the vessel could
                    afford their families and suite. Six pianos are on board the Warrior, and a
                    proportionate number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians
                    of course accompany the instruments to their destination.
                    The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the choicest breed, several
                    pens of sheep, considerable number of swine, two milch cows, and three
                    valuable horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be anticipated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, apprehensions
                    are entertained that a portion of the live cargo must be consigned to the
                    ocean before the termination of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the
                        advantageous arrangements entered into by the commander
                    and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the Warrior, and gone
                    out in her, they will clear the enormous sum of L10,000 by the
                    voyage.</p>

         <p>The King's Health.</p>
         <p>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavourable
                    accounts respecting his Majesty's health were circulating in
                    London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday evening. In our last we alluded
                    to the suspicions which the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after
                    the first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin appeared, certainly not of a character to remove the public
                    anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' silence. Every one
                    naturally puts the question, "If his Majesty is better, why not state this
                    in a bulletin, that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation
                    may be put to rest?" The Morning Chronicle says, that the high officers of State are not much better informed on
                    the subject than others, and that a knowledge of his Majesty's real
                    condition is confined to the very few immediately around his person.
                    In the absence of correct information, inferences are drawn from
                    every passing circumstance. It was observed that Sir Henry Halford very
                    shortly after his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a long
                    interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it has not escaped notice, that
                    his Majesty's sister, the Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit
                    him. The Globe says, that according to reports which
                    are circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness excites considerable alarm, and that gout in the stomach is complicated
                    with dropsical symptoms. What credit may be due to these statements, we
                    cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, they furnish a reason
                    for the publication of official intelligence. The King's health
                    is a matter which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and
                    deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We refer to our
                    London head for a variety of articles upon the subject ; and if this
                    night's mail bring any additional information of importance we
                    shall publish it in a secoond edition.</p>
         <p>The two Houses of Parliament meet again on Monday.</p>
         <p>We publish the address of the Birmingham Union to day, and meant to
                    accompany it with some remarks, but have only time at present to express
                    out regret that so masterly a paper, dealing in great and immutable principles, should have its value lessened by being
                    so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and with false or questionable
                    doctrines respecting currency.</p>
         <p>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not received any check. There
                    are four ships now at London, and as many more at other ports,
                    which are preparing to sail for the settlement with passengers.
                        Indeed the numbers who are flying from the country at
                    this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. Within the last
                    ten days we have seen notices of fifteen ships that were loading with
                    emigrants at Hull, twelve at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool,
                    and Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, or British
                    America. The exportation of human beings from the British Isles, to
                    different quarters of the world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one
                    or two thousand per week.</p>
         <p>It will be remembered, that according to reports from India received some
                    time ago, Lord William Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid
                    human sacrifices, the Suttees. Doubts were thrown
                    upon this intelligence when the subject was lately talked of in
                    Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that its accuracy is confirmed by the
                    arrival of the official document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian
                        Government, that it has been hitherto either so callous,
                    that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its own resources,
                    and the true state of the people under its authority, as to believe that it
                    had not power to effect its abolition.</p>
         <p>The report of a revolution having taken place in Chili, is confirmed in
                    letters from Bogota. The constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven
                    out of the capital by General Prieto with an armed force, and great
                    excesses are said to have been committed.</p>
         <p>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, with 2000 soldiers on
                    board. The expedition is supposed by some to be intended for the
                    invasion of Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in
                    keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– The plot to
                    which we alluded in our last, seems to have excited much alarm. Some of the
                    most opulent families in the island, with several lawyers and
                    official persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we
                    conjectured, to convert the island into an independent republic.</p>
         <p>From a detailed list published in the French papers, it appears that the
                    expedition against Algiers is to be composed of 34,000 men, infantry,
                    cavalray, and artillery.</p>
         <p>Farther intelligence has been received from the capital of
                    Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm address had been presented by the
                    Congress to Bolivar, entreating him not to abandon the republic at a moment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; and he
                    seems to have once more consented to remain in office. Commissioners had
                    been appointed to proceed to Valentia, and endeavour to
                    accomodate the differences between the people of Venezuela and the
                    central government, by peaceable means. If these failed it was
                    determined to employ force. The Congress was in session at Bogota, and was
                    proceeding to fulfil the object for which it had been assembled, by drawing
                    up a new constitution. The bases are published, and though the present
                    only an imperfect sketch of its plan, they disclose one or two features
                    which seem to be characteristic. The government is to be central, as it has hitherto been, not federal like that of the United States, which has
                    served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, and La Plata. In the one case the
                    supreme authority is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the
                        capital ; in the other it is divided among a number of
                    local assemblies, while the general congress representing
                    the whole, wields no other powers than what is necessary to hold
                    the separate members in a state of union. The federal system, which leaves
                    to every province the management of its own concerns, has advantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but
                    whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of an ignorant
                    people newly escaped from political convulsions, is very
                    questionable. There seems, however, to be a partiality for the
                    federal system in the new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new
                        constitution provides, that "Chambers of Districts" shall
                    be established, with powers to decide on all municipal and local
                    affairs. The difficulty will be, to give these bodies the powers necessary
                    to develope the industry and resources of the country, without permitting
                    them to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative functions, which
                    will interfere with the business of the general government. Another articl
                    state, that the members of the Senate and House of Representatives are to
                    hold their seats for a considerable time, in order " to avoid the
                    inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or the repeated election of
                    the same person." In the mouth of an English statesman, we should consider
                    this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made for the res dur? novitas regni, in a new state like
                    Colombia, formed of heterogenous elements, among which it is not
                    easy to establish any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns, the
                    Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving that the Catholic
                    religion is that of the state, and that no other shall be permitted. This
                    is merely a concescession for the sake of peace, to prejudice
                    which the government is not strong enough to subdue, and cannot defy without great danger. Nothing is said about the mode of
                    election, or the power of the President, two points of vital consequence,
                    which may give a new complexion to the whole scheme. We have made
                    these remarks on the proposed constitution, because it probably holds
                    out the last chance of composing the trouble of Columbia. If it does not
                    satisfy the people other provinces will soon follow the example of Venezuela, and all the address and influence of Bolivar will
                    not prevent the republic from splitting into four or five independent
                    communities, whose mutual jealousness and wars will crush the librties, and
                    destroy the prosperity of the whole.</p>

         <p>We are sorry to state that the private accounts received from
                    Windsor this afternoon, do not speak so favourably of his Majesty's health
                    as the Court Circular, and most of the assertions of the papers
                    published this afternoon. There having, however, been no bulletin issued up to the present hour (7 o'clock) must</p>

         <p>Swan River Settlement.–On the 13th inst. the
                    Swedish ship Sterling, Captain D. E. Hogan, with a
                    Swedish crew, sailedfrom Gottenburgh, Sept. 22, for the settlement in
                    Swan River. Among the cargo are eleven wooden houses, built here, and
                    consisting of four to ten rooms, which have been taken to pieces and
                    will be easily put up again, all the pieces being marked.
                    It is probable that many similar cargoes will follow, as timber
                    and labour are so cheap in this country.</p>

         <p>The Wool Trade.–London, Thursday
                        Night.–This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time past took place
                    at Garraway's Coffee-house. The quantity announced for sale to-day was
                    nearly 200 bales, consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales
                    wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The New South Wales
                    wool was first put up and went off very briskly at prices averaging from 1s
                    4 1/2d to 1s 10d per lb., which quotations are higher than those last
                    obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold by order of the Van
                    Dieman's Land Company, being a portion of the last arrivals from the
                    Company's flocks. They met a very ready sale, and the average prices obtained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals from
                    Germany and other places this year are expected to be very great.</p>

      <text>
         <p>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The Examiner of Saturday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which
                    appeared in our paper on the excess of females over males in the
                    census, which he assures us is entirely owing to the lives of females being
                    prolonged by their better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the habit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom we
                    were supposed by implication to be cut off permanently by
                    intemperance! We admit that a few hearty fellows do go off in apoplexy; but
                    we deny that the number bears any proportion to the amount supposed;
                    we have two other remarks to make on his statement. First,
                    since our manners were corrupted by imitating English fashions, it is whispered, we hope un, that
                    there are such things as tippling women in country, some of whom do
                    disappear suddenly–no matter how; and secondly, we wish our London
                    friend inform us how it happens, that while all Broad England has only
                    an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, Edinburgh should have no less than
                    24! We understand that since this astounding fact was brought
                    out, there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to the
                    adjoining counties. We know a number who have or are flying to Fife and the
                    north. A friend, who careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of
                    the Jews. The ladies, he says, attribute their flight to Cholera Maribus!</p>

         <p>The Machine Breakers.–A convict ship at
                        Portsmouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's
                    Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on board, who have
                    been lately convicted for machine breaking, extorting money, and
                    other offences committed in the disturbed counties. Another
                    ship, with convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for
                    New South Wales, in about a fortnight. These convicts have
                    been kept entirely separate from all other prisoners, and an accurate
                    report will be made to the Governors of the Colonies, as to their former
                    character, their trades and employments, and the recommendations which have been made in their favour subsequently to
                    their trials. The capital convicts whose lives have been spared, are to be
                    transported for life; and the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the
                    Judges for transportation, are to be transported according to their
                    respective sentences.</p>

         <p>Extensive preparations are already begun amongst e[?] shipping, for the
                    various Spring voyages to distant ports[?]. Six vessels are advertised for
                    America, one for Van Dieman's Land and New South Wales, and the
                    whalers[?] are unfurling their canvass, and will sail for the [?]
                    regions on Monday or Tuesday first. The departure of these ships
                    will give the docks a naked appearance, the more apparent from

         <p>Mr Hume differed from the view taken of the subject by the right hon. baronet. He was of opinion that it
                    was the duty of Government to give commutation allowance to
                    pensioners anxious to emigrate either to New South Wales or to Canada. He
                    could not forebear complaining of the large increase of pensions which
                    had taken place since the year 1814. It was impossible to doubt that much
                    misconduct had existed somewhere.</p>

      <header>The Penal Colonies Botany Bay...</header>
      <text>
         <p>The Penal Colonies.</p>
         <p>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose reformation is
                    hopeless, and whom it is therefore desirable to remove from the
                    Society to whose peace and security they are sworn enemies. This
                    is the sole value of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be
                    had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the gibbet.
                    Experience shews, however, that transportation does not produce the
                    intended effect of terrifying the guilty. Its monitory operation depends
                    greatly on the situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers with
                    families dread it extremely, while to single men, mechanics who are sure of
                    receiving high wages, and generally to all those who feel a desire of
                    change, and a vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears
                    to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there is a competition
                    among settlers to obtain convinct servants, and those who get them,
                    endeavour, from a regard to their own interest to render the situation
                    of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The evidence proves,
                    that when the feeling degradation is once overcome, the
                    situation of the Australian convict "is, in many respects, preferable to
                    that of the agricultural labourer in this country :" He has better
                    clothing, more abundant food, and enjoys a finer climate. The
                    hardship, too, of compulsory labour is but for a limited time. The convict
                    who is transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, at the
                    end of 8years. Once possessed of this ticket he is allowed to work on his
                    own account, and with high wages, easily acquires capital. The committee see little chance of rendering punishment effective in the colony. They recommend various subordinate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a remedy for the
                    great expense attending transportation, that no convict be assigned to a
                    settler until he shall have paid, or given security for the payment by
                        instalments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of
                    the convict from the mother country.</p>
         <p>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase of crime is to be
                    found, first, in the diffusion of education and sound knowledge
                    ; and, second, in the improvement of our judicial and municipal
                    institutions. Law, in all its important branches, should be dispensed by
                    paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to be stationed in each
                    small district, and keep open court every day of the year. He should be
                    chosen by some popular constituency, which would faithfully represent
                    the feelings of the mass of suitors; and as a guarantee for his diligence,
                    he should hold his office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Justices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected as in
                    most of the American states, by the householders for three, four, or seven
                    years. Jails also, should be placed under the controul of popular bodies,
                    and thrown open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. In
                    this, as in other points, we have much to learn from the Americans, who
                    never forget that the criminal is still a man. The grand defect in our
                    legislation has been, that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose
                    situation they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feelings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no
                    sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a barbarism
                    belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years hence men will wonder how
                    their forefathers tolerated so monstrous a system.</p>

         <p>Trade</p>
         <p>Wool–The accounts received in Lond from New
                    South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce of the last
                    year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest than that of the
                    preceding year, and the the quality has also considerably
                    improved. From Van Dieman's Land it is now ascertained that the
                    supply this year will be short, but the general quality is very superior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large
                    arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales and the private
                    contract business is expected to be very active. The public sales of wools
                    went off on Friday very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week
                    have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 bales were Van
                    Dieman's Land wools, and the rest German. There is a steady
                    demand, and as it is understood that the manufacturers are short
                    of stock, the anticipations are that trade will son be greatly
                    improved.</p>
         <p>York Wool Market, May 23.–The market commenced here for this season this day, with only a small
                    show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders asking very
                    high prices caused part to be left unsold. The following are the prices ;
                    Hogs from 18s to 19s ; Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to
                    12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.</p>
         <p>Bradford Market–The supply of Merinos in the
                    markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal to the
                    demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Merinoes were
                    eagerly bought up, and in some instances a farther advance was obtained ;
                    three quarter wide Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty supply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from 4s
                    to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at the beginning of the year,
                    and three quarter wide are proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes
                    place in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must have a
                    further advance.</p>
         <p>Rochdale Flannel Market.–The market today was
                    very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both for white and
                    for dyeing were of very ready sale, and in some instances a little advance
                    was obtained ; several sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the
                    demand proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is very
                    promising.</p>
         <p>Liverpool Cotton Market.–There has been but a
                    limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales are only about
                    10,000 bugs, at declining prices.</p>

         <p>The Wool Trade.–The whole of the London public
                    sales of Colonial and other woold having now been gone through, the
                    wool trade is in a more settled state, and transactions by private contract
                    are conducted on a more extensive scale. The total amount of the late
                    sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was 4,000 bales, and
                    the colonial wools were taken by the manufactures at the extreme advance
                    realized at the previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quotations from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. The
                    sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and increased
                    boldness was observed. The colonial wools offered on that day fetched
                    excellent prices. Some few bales were also offered, forming a part of the
                    second clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. They were
                    much better in quality than those last received. Some German
                    lambs' wool also commanded attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per
                    lb. The sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite so
                    fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according to quality, full
                    prices were obtained. The sale consisted of 437 bales New South Wales and
                    Van Diemen's Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and 72
                    bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. The best fleece of
                    Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to 3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d
                    per lb ; the best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d to
                    2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van Diemen's Land 1s 8d to
                    1s 10d ; and the best German 2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales
                    is to establish a much firmer market for wools of all
                    descriptions than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are
                    limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, and abotu 375
                    bales of Neapolitan wool have been entered at the custom house.

         <p>The returns to the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr Stewart Mackenzie,
                    relative to emigration, contain some curious and important

      <header>EmigrationThe subject of emigration...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>The subject of emigration is rising in
                    importance from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long as
                    much misery or much discontent exists among our working classes. Upper
                    Canada, the great recipient of our surplus population, is 4000 miles from
                    Britain, a distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such is the
                    amazing economy of water carriage, when seconded by good
                    arrangements, that the voyage by sea to Montreal can be made at as small
                    expense as the journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money from
                    Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) has been as low as 30s ;
                    and it would not be higher probably from Leith or Greenock, if the
                    emigrants were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their arrangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what was
                    strictly necessary for taking her full compliment aboard. If the ship is
                    detained a month before this is got, the owners must, of course, be
                    indemnified for the detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal,
                    with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a man or
                    woman on the voyage ; and thus a human being can be conveyed
                    over a distance equal to one-sixth part of the circumference of the globe,
                    and six times longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at
                    the small coast of 45s !</p>
         <p>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid strides with which
                    emigration was advancing ; and some Parliamentary papers we have received
                    since, exhibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It
                    has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most sanguine.</p>
         <p>The following table shows the number of person who have emigrated in the
                    last eight years to North America, the Cape, and Australia :–</p>
         <p>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. 1825
                    8,714 5,551 114 485 14,891 1826 12,818 7,063 116 903 20,900 1827 12,
                    14,526 114 715 28,003 1828 12,084 12,817 135 1,056 26,092 1829 13,307
                    15,678 197 2,916 31,198 1830 30,574 24,887 204 1,242 56,907 1831
                    58,067 23,418 11 1,561 83,160 1832 66,339 32,872 196 3,733 103,140</p>
         <p>It will be seen from this table how steady the increase of
                    emigration has been, especially to Canada. It must be observed, that a
                    great proportion, probably more than a half of those who sailed for the
                    United States, were destined for the British colonies, and only chose
                    that route as the most eligible, on account of the facilities which the
                    Hudson and its associated canals present for travelling to the upper
                    province. Canada and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 settlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the capacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that
                    the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; and from the
                    previous arrangements made, it is announced that a much larger
                    number of persons could have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine
                    as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that emigration
                    could be conducted on such a scale, with the extraordinary ease, certainty,
                    and economy now exemplified. Those who reflect on the distress
                    and perplexity which would be produced by landing the sixth-part of eighty thousand strangers on the
                    shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate the extremely dissimilar
                    condition of a colony which, with less than a million inhabitants, can take
                    in eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without
                    embarassment or confusion.</p>
         <p>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 souls from her
                    population last year, of whom a[?] number sailed 7000 miles, a number
                    14,000, and those who made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of
                    emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any part of the world
                    ; and yet we may reasonably expect to see still greater things
                    atcheived.</p>
         <p>It appears from the various census since 1801, that the annual increase in
                    Britain, if no persons left it, would be about 350,000; or we may place the
                    fact in a more striking light by stating, that there are
                        about athousand persons more in the three kingdoms everyday than there was on the day before. If by raising
                    the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could get this daily
                    increase reduced one half, and the other half could be carried off by
                    emigration–if we could by this means keep the supply of labour
                        stationary while capital was increasing, a great improvement
                    would be effected in the state of the population. Now from what has
                    been stated it appears that the emigrants who leave our shores annually
                    amount to nearly one third of the annual excess already ; and in
                    a year or two there is every probability that it will amount to
                    one-half.</p>
         <p>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and Montreal last year, 17,500 went
                    from England, 28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In the
                    year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, Ireland 34,100, Scotland
                    5,300.</p>
         <p>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sailed from
                    Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cromarty, 478 from Aberdeen,
                    439 from Dundee, 231 from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from
                    Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, and numbers under 100
                    from Stanraer, Peterhead, and Irvine.</p>
         <p>Of the emigrants to the United States last year 15,754 sailed from
                    Liverpool, 5,546 from London 2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry,
                    and 1,711 from Greenock.</p>
         <p>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, states in his Report, that "the
                    general description of emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable
                    and wealthy families came from all part of the united kingdom ;
                    and the extent of property and specie brought into the country by them
                    is exceedingly great, fully amounting to from t600,000 to t700,000
                    sterling." About 5000 persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes
                    or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pensioners"
                    (military, we believe), many of them men of irregular habits, and ill
                    fitted for the situation of settlers. Of these, about 100
                    returned to Britain. The fear of cholera was a considerable check to
                    emigration. It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the persons
                    who arrived after that, suffered much from the difficulty of procuring
                    lodgings even for a day ; but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of
                        emigrants who fell victims to the disease, at no more
                    than</p>
         <p>"The demand for all classes of working people (says the Report,) has never
                    been exceeded in the Canadas, particularly since the abatement
                    of the cholera, and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late
                    tour through the districts and settlements of Upper Canada, I did not
                    see an industrious emigrant who could not meet with emplyment. The number
                    of that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply the demand
                    created by the more wealthy emigrants. This was particularly felt in the
                    Western and London districts of the upper province, where the want of labourers was so great that it was found necessary to encourage a number to come over from Ohio and Pennsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, and the arrival of
                    emigrants closed in October.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Emigration to New South Wales and VanDiemen's Land</p>
         <p>The following document has just been issued from the Colonial
                    Office:–</p>
         <p>Downing street, April 6, 1834. Numerous applicants have been received from
                        persons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van
                    Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to defray
                    the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid for that purpose, on
                    condition of repaying the same out of their earnings in the colony where
                    they propose to settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the
                    appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial revenues
                    of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to assist the private funds of
                    such emigrants as may appear likely to earn the means of repayig
                    that aid, and to become useful settlers. The following are the regulations under which this induglence will be dispensed:–</p>
         <p>No advance will be made except to young and married agricultural
                    labourers, who intend taking their wives and families with them : and a
                    strict inquiry will be instituted into their character and habits of
                    industry, before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them.</p>
         <p>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding t20; and it will be
                    useful therefore for parties, who may not possess the remainder of the sum
                    requisite for defraying the expense of their passage, to apply for assistance.</p>
         <p>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed advance must fill
                    up, and send back to the Under Secretary of State for the
                    Colonial Department, the return hereto annexed. If the information
                    contained in this return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be
                    addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of the return,
                    shall be considered satisfactory, the applicant will receive
                    notice to that effect. He may then proceed to make his agreement with the
                    owners or masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or Van
                    Diemen's land, and as soon as any ship-owner or master shall notify (in a
                    form which will be provided for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken
                    the other necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order will be
                    granted for the payment in the colony, of t20 to the agent or master of the
                    vessel in which this emigrant may arrive. The emigrant will of course be
                    able to[?] ob-[?] tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?]
                    paid by himself in this country.</p>
         <p>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] ter of the vessel in which the
                    emigrants to pro[?] and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor,
                    containing the name and description of the party on whose account the
                    money is to be paid, and encolosing a promissory note, which he will be
                    required to sign in acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be witnessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But
                    arrangements will be made, by which the payment of this order will not
                    take place in the colony until the captain shall have produced the parties,
                    on whose account it is to be made, before the officer appointed
                    for that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh obligation
                    for the repayment of the advance made to them. For it is the intention of
                    his Majesty's Government, and cannot be too clearly understoof
                    by all persons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the
                    debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may not be
                    unsuitable to the circumstances of each emigrant) shall be
                    strictly enforced, by means of the ample powers which the laws of the
                    colony render available for that purpose.</p>
         <p>Government agents for emigration have been appointed at
                    Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Belfast, and
                    Greenock, who have been instructed to afford gratuitous information to all
                    persons applying to them as to the best means of carrying their schemes of
                        emigration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside
                    in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to apply to them
                    either personally (or if by letter post paid) for information on this
                    subject.</p>
         <p>All application for the assistance of government must be made by letter
                    only, addressed to R. W. Hay, Esq. Under Secretary of State, London ; and
                    should the number of applications be greater than the funds at their
                    disposal will enable them to comply with, priority of date will form the
                    rule of selection among applications in which there shall appear no other
                    groun of distinction.W. R. Hay.</p>

         <p>We understand, from good authority, that Government has
                    decided upon sanctioning the foundation of a new colony on the coast of
                    South Australia. The plan on which this undertaking is to be conducted is
                    explained in a work entitled "England and America." This first act of
                    Mr Stanley's successor is an earnest of his becoming a most valuable
                    Minister for the colonies of this country.</p>

      <header>South Australian EmigrationAssociation A meeting...</header>
      <text>
         <p>South Australian EmigrationAssociation.</p>
         <p>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Association was
                    held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the purpose of explaining
                    the principles, objects, plan, and prospects of a new colony," proposed to
                    be founded in South Australia. Mr W. Whitmore in the chair.</p>
         <p>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first question which the
                    meeting would have to consider would be this–whether there existed
                    or not at present any necessity for a more extended system of colonization.
                    It appeared to him that there was a great defect in our present system of
                    colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if we
                    established it upon a new principle, well and seriously considered. That
                    which struck him as the greatest defect was, that we did not provided that
                    colonization which included within it members of all classes of
                    society. Large numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carrying with them that number of the lower class which was
                    necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other cases,
                    perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out without capital which was
                    necessry to enable him to employ his labour to advantage. This was a
                    striking defect. Now the question which they were then called upon to
                    consider, regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those
                    means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might be
                    accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a system
                    that all the waste lands which they were about to colonize
                    should be sold at a given price, such as the market would command, and that
                    the proceeds of such sales should be employed in sending out to the
                    colonies a sufficient number of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold.
                    If this system could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the
                    evils of our present system of colonization would be removed, and that
                    we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the community of
                    the mother country with all its various grades into the new country which
                    they now proposed to coloniz. He believed that if we proceeded upon this
                    principle, we should lay the foundation of the greatest colony which
                    England had ever settled.</p>
         <p>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the wealth and
                    prosperity of this country have been greatly promoted by the
                    establishment of British colonies in various parts of the world, and that
                    colonization, when conducted systematically and upon sound principles,
                    offers the means of extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the
                    united kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and
                    labour." He would not enter into the recommendations which this
                    undertaking offered to all classes of the community ; but he
                    would venture to state, that to any gentleman who considered the prospectus
                    which had been put out by the association, and who recollected that it was
                    a matter of certainty that the land in the colony was to be used
                    as the means of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was
                    superabundant here, it must be evident that from this important innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be derived[?]
                    both to the new colony and to the mother country.</p>
         <p>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at great length into the
                    difficulty of finding employment, which now prevails in all parts of the
                    community, and then, after condemning the corn laws, continued
                    thus–Colonization, if carried on to a considerable extent, would as
                    effectually add millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea
                    were filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it not
                    clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that the emplyment
                    which the addition of so many fertile acres would afford must give a new
                    stimulus to the prosperity of the country ? Is it not clear that the
                    miserable compotation[?] for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and
                    that the difficulties flowing from an unemployed population
                    would cease ? Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of
                    our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. (Hear.)
                    Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were added to our own
                    island, because, if this plan of colonization be adopted, a transplantation
                    of a sufficiency of labourers, now wanting employment, from this country,
                    for its culture, will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation
                    of the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins these
                    distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)– There can be no
                    doubt but that a wider comercial code, and the removal of restrictions on
                    labour, would greatly facilitate, extend, and increase the commercial
                    intercourse between the old nation of the world ; but in no case would the
                    increase be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the
                    consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in other
                    climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it is virtually an
                    extension of the mother country.</p>
         <p>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– "That in
                    establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken to combine labour and
                    capital with land, in such proportions as are best calculated to
                    insure the prosperity of all classes of society, and that, in establishing
                    modern colonies, this important consideration has been so generally
                        overlooked." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to
                    state that in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought
                    to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple principle had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had led new
                    colonies from the mother country. In the first place, the whole of the land
                    of this colony was to be public land. No individual was to obtain a single
                    acre by gift. There was to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on
                    a footing of equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for
                    nothing. There would also be another advantage in this system, which would arise in the following :–In other colonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could get land
                    for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that land was wealth,
                    instead of it being merely the means of producing wealth. That fatal
                    mistake had often led him to refuse the work of the master with whom he had
                    gone out, and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had
                    in consequence set up, where he was far away from the market of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey his
                    produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in this colony the
                    labourers would be compelled for some time to work for hire.</p>
         <p>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following
                    effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of a
                    new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any exception,
                    shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to individuals by sale
                    only, and according to an uniform, impartial, and permanent
                    system."</p>
         <p>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the highest terms of the
                    salubrity of the climate of Australia. Many of his fellow soldiers in India
                    had gone there for the recovery of their health, and had found something so
                        temperate and soothing in the country, that they had retired
                    there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the chills
                    of their native country, England.</p>
         <p>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that the whole of the
                    purchase money of public land, without any deduction, should be employed in
                    providing a free passage from the mother country to the colony, of young
                    adult persons of the labouring class, who may be willing to
                    emigrate, and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of
                    labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the more
                    labour they imported, the greater labour did they give their land ; the
                    more they got for the sale of it, the greater was their power of importing
                    fresh labour. This resolution, therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon
                    itself, and when it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed
                        onwards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity,
                    meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of England to
                    part with her inhabitants.</p>
         <p>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied portions of
                    the earth which form part of the British dominions, the south coast of
                    Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly suitable for founding a colony
                    upon the principles embodied in the preceding resolutions." The place where
                    this colony was to be founded was one distinguished from every other
                    part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal
                    communications prior even to the formation of roads, and the soil
                    would amply repay the labour expended on its cultivation.</p>
         <p>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of this colony abounded
                    with whales, and that its whale fisheries might become
                    valuable.</p>
         <p>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the mode of carrying
                    the principles of this association into effect. No colony could go on
                    without some law. He did not care how little they had of it, provided they
                    made up in quality what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered
                    into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enacted for the colony, and concluded by moving–"That the
                    provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the British
                    Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill now before
                    Parliament, are highly satisfactory."</p>
         <p>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution.</p>
         <p>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., seconded the
                    following resolution :–"That it is the opinion of this meeting that
                    the thanks of the country are due to Mr Spring Rice for his prompt and
                    enlightened conduct in promoting the beneficial public object of
                    the South Australian Association."</p>
         <p>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were given to the Chairman,
                    and the meeting, at which many ladies were present, broke up. The
                    proceedings lasted from twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.</p>

         <p>House of Commons.–July 28(Continued from our last.)</p>
         <p>A message from the Lords announced that their Lordships had agreed to the
                    Amendments to the Ministers Appointment (Scotland) bill ; to the Newspaper
                    Postage bill ; and to the Orkney Statute Labour bill.</p>
         <p>Affairs of Oude</p>
         <p>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Universities' Admission bill being moved–</p>
         <p>Mr Herriks[?] took the occasion of calling on
                    Government to explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain
                    transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India
                    directors. These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to be the
                    repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Controul to the
                    Directors of the East India Company to prepare a despatch for the purpose
                    of directing the Indian Government to compel the King of Oude,
                    to pay certain claims made on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which
                    commands the Court of Directors refused to obey, on the ground that the
                        interference which the Board of Controul required them to
                        exercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the
                        relations subsisting between the British Government and the
                    King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On the 31st of
                    January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, and obtained a rule to
                    show cause why, under the act of Parliament, a mandamus should not issue to compel the Court of Directors to
                    comply with the desire ofthe Board of Controul. On the 31st of
                    January, 1834, the Court of King's bench was prepared to give its decision
                    upon the application for the mandamus, when, without
                    any reason being assigned, the right hon. President of the Board of
                    Controul withdrew his application.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Grant said that in the regret which had been
                        expressed respecting the possible collision between the two
                    authorities, he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he
                    confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. Friend
                    endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. The right honourable
                    gentleman then proceeded to give a brief outline of the case, and referred
                    to the various high authorities connected with India, who had declared in
                    favour of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the application for the mandamus without
                    explanation, he had to say that he fully explain his opinions to the
                    Directors, he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did
                    not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re
                    enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the
                    recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the claim upon
                    his attention.</p>
         <p>Sir R. Peel said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and
                    in the present state of the world most inconvenient, that the nonpayment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of
                    England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, except where sanctioned by positive treaty.</p>
         <p>Mr Hume contended, that on the whole, the debt was a
                    just one, and ought to be paid.</p>
         <p>The subject here dropped.</p>
         <p>Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</p>
         <p>On the question that this bill be read a third time,</p>
         <p>Mr T. Gladstone rose to oppose it. It would, he said,
                    be useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inoperative. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if passed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected
                    to its principle, the admission of which was equally destructive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. Further,
                    they were bound to respect corporate rights as long as the intentions of
                    their founders were fulfilled ; and no one could deny that the Universities
                    did fulfilthe intentions of their founders." (Hear, hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr V. Smith supported the bill, as one calculated to
                    take away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a
                    compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exercise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science and
                    literature.</p>
         <p>Mr Baines said, that the original statutes showed that
                    there were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the
                    time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had in it an
                    argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learning, which
                    were meant to be universal, both as to the subjects taught, and
                    the persons to whom they were communicated. In this sense, the
                    term was understood and applied in other countries, and it was an
                    extraordinary fact, deserving of attention, that the Universities of Oxford
                    and of Cambridge were the only universities that were closed to a large
                        proportion of the upper classes of the people in any country
                    in Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous
                    indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should attempt
                    to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the best seats of literature
                    and science.</p>
         <p>Mr H. Hughes could not accede to the measure, and
                        therefore moved that it be read that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr Goulburn contended that the introduction of the
                        Dissenters, as proposed under the present bill, would be
                    nothing short of the destruction of the present system of education at
                    the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, religion could only be taught according to some set form :
                    abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion itself.
                    (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was perfectly obvious
                    the intentions of the founders of those establishments would be
                    completely defeated : he therefore deprecated the measures as
                    injurious to religon and opposed to the best interest of the country.</p>
         <p>Lord Palmerstone, Sir R. Inglis, and Mr G. Wood then addressed
                    the house, but amidst such discordant noises as prevented what they said
                    being heard. The laughing, jeering, shouting, were such as has
                    seldom been heard. In particular two hon. members who entered
                    from the smoking room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr
                    Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the seats secure
                    from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a row of the most
                    discreditable character. The Speaker, with much indignation in his tone and
                    manner, called the parties to order.</p>
         <p>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, by 164 to 25. The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ireland)
                    Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went through
                    committees.</p>
         <p>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures Bill, and the
                    Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a third time and passed.</p>
         <p>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes Repeal Bill, and the
                    Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were brought in, and read a first time.</p>
         <p>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
         <p>Tuesday, July 29.</p>
         <p>Sir John Cam Hobhouse and General Sir Edward Barnes, took the oaths and their seats ;
                    the former for Nottingham, in the room of Lord Duncannon, raised to the
                    Peerage ; the latter for Sudbury, in the room of M. A. Taylor, Esq.
                    deceased.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Alderman Thompson the Durham and
                    Sunderland Railway bill was read a third time and passed.</p>
         <p>Southern Australia</p>
         <p>Mr S. Rice moved the order of the day for the house
                    to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization of
                    Southern Australia,</p>
         <p>Mr A.Baring rose and stated various objections to the
                        project. The hon. member contended that at this period of
                    the year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important
                    subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he said he
                    did not conceive that government ought to sanction any such experiment
                    without a full conviction that there was a reasonable probability of its
                    success. In his opinion the experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken
                    than any similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to
                    the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied up by
                    mortgages in such a way, that it would not again revert to the
                    Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The result would be, that if
                    the gentlemen who set the project on foot were mistaken–as he was
                    sure they had been–we would be prevented from touching this large
                    portion of Australia, unless we could pay off the debt which had been
                    contracted. While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious
                    not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for he was very
                    favourable to it. Every new opening to colonization he was
                    convinced was a substantial benefit to the poorer classes, (Hear, hear,
                    hear.) It was not, therefore, to the principle of colonization that he was
                    opposed, but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most
                    mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large portion of the
                    world. One of his main objections was to the extent to which it was
                    proposed to carry the experiment. Let the gentlemen take, if they like, 100
                    square miles, but let them not risk the whole of a great continent. People,
                    like fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might get
                    a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the tens of thousands
                    to go which were required for the success of the project. The hon. member
                    then objected to two of the principles which were laid down by the
                    projectors, that land should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that
                    no credit should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted
                    with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, would
                    blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who went out to Australia would
                    think of taking less than two hundred acres. Now that would cost him t120;
                    it would cost him t120 more to get himself and his family over; which,
                    with stock and other expenses, would amount to t500 or t600. He would,
                    therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whether they thought
                    any man who had t500 or t600 in this country, would go out and set himself
                    down on two hundred acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore
                    suggested to his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be postponed until another session, and then have it referred to a
                    select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amendment,
                    that the bill be committed on that day six months.</p>
         <p>Mr W. Whitmore was thakful for the very candid manner
                    in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. With
                    respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) thought that was
                    necessary, as it was intended to introduce a completely new system of
                    colonization–one very different from any thing ever before
                    attempted. The extent of land it was intended to take under this act was
                    from 500,000 to 600,000 square miles, and it was the leading principle of
                    the bill that all the money arising from the sale of lands should be
                    applied to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.–
                    (Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a constant
                    stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the Canada Company had been
                    at a higher price. He had sanguine hopes that all the money it
                    would be necessary to borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously
                        considered that this bill would prove a very great benefit
                    to the country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and
                    amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, and
                    therefore he hoped it would pass.</p>
         <p>Mr O'Dwyer contended that, before the house thought of
                    agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something towards
                    the ameloriation of the condition of the people of Ireland. The various
                    reports which committees of that house had made, showed that one-fourth of
                    the land of that country was untilled, but was at the same time what was
                    called reclaimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation
                    and produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the surplus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the cultivation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from
                        Ireland entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give
                    them that and the house would hear no more about murders, fires, and
                    other outrages.</p>
         <p>Mr S. Rice in reference to the allusion made by the
                    hon. and learned member, begged to say that, although much of the bog
                    land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a portion of it was
                    the property of the Government, who had been, and still were, making
                    experiments, with a view to ascertain if the views of the
                    Commissioners could be carried into effect. With respect to the manner in
                    which the hon. member for Essex had opened this question, he
                    must confess that he had brought with him much of usefulness and of
                        experience, and of such a character, too, as could not fail
                    to carry weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak in
                    favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia</p>
         <p>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the
                    house divided, when there appeared–For going into committee, 72;
                    against it 7–Majority, 65.</p>
         <p>The bill went through the committee. The report was received, and
                    ordered to be taken into further consideration on Thursday next.</p>
         <p>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the Speaker left
                    the chair.</p>

         <p>The St Nicholas, Morgan, which has arrived off
                    Aberdeen from Bathurst, New South Wales, reports that timber was very
                    scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that
                    250 tons of cut timber had been burnt, and the people in the woods had
                    been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The
                    thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor of the embryo colony
                    in South Australia, and we believe that a fitter appointment
                    could not have been made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not
                    been sent to superintend a colony founded on something like
                    sane principles. But if this Australian project end, as we have
                    little doubt it will do, in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough
                    to embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the failure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. The whole blame will
                    fall on the contrivers of the scheme.</p>

         <p>Emigration.–According to a general return of
                        emigrants who have left Liverpool for the British colonies
                    and the United States of America, it appears that from the 7th of May
                    1833, to the 30th September 1834, 3,121 persons left there for the
                    colonies, and 27,486 for the United States, making a grand total of 30,607
                    persons. The ships employed were 455 ; the tonnage 196,058, and the
                    crews, 8,9956. The chief of the emigrants to the United States,
                    disembarked at New York, 24,311 having landed there. Of the emigrants
                    to the colonies, 1,289 went to Australia, and 1,227 to Quebec. The
                    emigration to the West Indies during the above period, only
                    amounted to 12 to the smaller islands, 3 to Antigua, 32 to Jamaica, and 26
                    to Demerara. The emigrants to Van Diemen's Land were 135.</p>

                    their passage on board the ship Canton, for Sydney. The emigrants
                    were, for the most part, fine healthy looking girls, some of them of
                    exceedingly interesting appearance, and almost all of a class much above

         <p>Emigration–We observe from an advertisement
                    in our paper of to-day, that another ship is fitting out by
                    Government, for the free conveyance of females to Van Dieman's Land ; and
                    as we understand that many applications were made too late for the last
                    ship, we would recommend those anxious to take advantage of this
                    opportunity, to lose no time in making the neccessary
                    application at Leith,–the number being strictly limited, and being
                    the last ship to sail this year. We consider it of great advantage to
                    females of respectability, that none are admitted without a
                    strict investigation into their moral character by the
                    Emigration Committee ; and that those of a superior class, as
                    governesses, &amp;c. are provided a small sum, to defray the expense of the extra outfit.</p>

         <p>South Australia.–The act of Parliament for
                        founding this colony will now come into full operation ; the
                    Commissioners having complied with the conditions precedent, by the
                    sale of t35,000 worth of land, and by raisingthe required loan for the
                    government of the colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the
                    names of the various officers gazetted (some of them have been long
                    ago nominated) ; and we understand that active preparations are making with
                    a view to the immediate departure of the officers and a small body of
                    emigrants. This first expedition will be placed under the
                    command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the Governor ; who, with the assistance
                    of the Surveyors and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the
                    various harbours in the colony, the quality of the neighbouring soil,
                    the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will select that site which, all things
                    considered, is most desirable for the first town. We believe it is the
                        intention of the Commissions not to send out the main
                    body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow ample time for
                    the necessary preparations for their reception.–Spectator.</p>
         <p>There have been 300 convents suppressed within the last three years. The
                    example was set by the Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st
                    July 1832, abolished 187 convents of monks. This was followed by the
                    King of Prussia, who, by a royal order, secularised all the convents in the
                    Duchy of Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, and Spain
                    has lately abolished 1800.</p>

         <p>Emigration.–It will be observed, from an
                        advertisement in to-day's paper, that Government are fitting
                    another ship for the free conveyance of single
                    females from London to Van Dieman's Land ; and from the great demand
                    for agricultural labourers, and mechanics of every description,
                    in that colony, it has been resolved to grant a passage to that class, at a
                    cost not above what is paid to America–Government paying the
                    remainder of the sum as a bounty, amounting to t30, which may certainly be
                    looked upon as a great boon, both by individuals and the colony at large.
                    In all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of working people, as from an official document in our possession, it
                    is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada agricultural labourers,
                    domestic servants, and tradesmen of every description, will be
                    for some years in great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from
                    t25 to t30 per annum, with board, lodging, and washing, and
                    day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, with provisions. The government
                    agent for emigration for the Canadas asserts he could find
                        immediate employment for 20,000 working people, as public improvements are much retarded for want of hands. As
                    this is the best season, we would advise all those intending to emigrate to
                    apply to the government agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith,
                    who will give gratuitous information regarding the colonies, and
                    advise as to the best method of putting their plans into execution. The
                    rate of wages for every description of mechanics may be likewise seen
                    there.</p>

         <p>The New Australian Colony.–The Cygnet, with
                    the first party of emigrants to the New Colony of South Australia,
                    will sail to-day from Gravesend ; eight gentlemen have gone out as
                    surveyors, taking with them upwards of twenty artisans and labourers, a
                        surgeon, steward, and harbour-master.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>Australian Colonies.–We have seen a
                        printed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr
                    John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emigrant ship
                        Canton, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835,
                    addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the Emigration
                    Committee, London. In this letter Mr Sullivan mentions that the female
                    emigrants, on landing, were placed in spacious and commodious
                        buildings, adjoining the Government House, at Sydney, where every attention was paid to their comfort and security from improper intrusion. The writer further states
                    :–" We landed in Sydney a greater proportion of well conducted,
                    industrious, and virtuous young women, than were ever before landed
                    from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee that came to these
                    Colonies. Three-fourths of the young women were engaged, and went into
                        comfortable situations, on the first and second days after
                        landing ; and before a week all the useful and good servants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work,
                    dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many of them in Syndey
                    and the surroundings districts ; several were taken up the
                    country to Maitland and Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses,
                        dairymaids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places
                    in that time, for these are the descriptions of female servants in
                    demand throughout the colony. The wages varied from t8 to t20. Some, who
                    were not very good servants of all work and housemaids, got t8 to t10
                    ; cooks and laundresses, t12 to t16 (the latter are much wanted) ;
                    housemaids and needlewomen, t10 to t12 ; housekeepers, t16 to
                    t20. Governesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had
                    twenty qualified they could have got situations in respectable
                    families and schools ; but the salaries to this class are small, say t25 to
                    t40. Nursery governesses got t20. All the male emigrants who
                        understood agriculture, or the management of stock in general, but particularly sheep, were engaged immediately, at salaries varying from t40 to t50, with a house and rations
                    for family use." We understand that the Canton had a
                    number of females from Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and the
                    above information must be highly satisafactory to their
                    relatives.</p>

      <header>Sir George Clerk –As the...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Sir George Clerk.–As the cawing of the
                    rooks portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that the cunning
                    baronet has come down from London, and commenced a canvass in this county
                    within these few days. It is stated, we believe upon good authority, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, by
                    referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish
                    Municipal Bill.</p>
         <p>Burn's Monument.–We understand that there
                    is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument, which has
                    too long remained in an unfinished state, to the surprise of
                    strangers, and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in
                    the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the handsome musical work
                    lately issued by Mr M'Leod, which he has generously devoted to that
                    purpose, is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the
                    expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around
                    the monument. We expect, therefore, that the work will forthwith
                    be commenced, and if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt
                    there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly
                    guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the
                    undertaking.</p>
         <p>Annuity Tax.–We understand that deputations
                    from several places in the country, are expected to attend the public
                    meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of
                    petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax, in
                    order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for
                    its support. We observe that Mr Gillon, of Wallhouse, M.P. is to take the
                    chair. The meeting we doubt not, will be most numerously attended.</p>
         <p>Law of Scotland.–The prizes given by Professor Bell, for the greatest proficiency in the examinations, were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish, 25,
                    India Street, in the senior, and to William Spence, 31, Broughton Place, in
                    the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished
                    themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser, James Gilchrist, James
                    Mason, James Scott, in the senior class; James Oliver, David Gale, John R.
                    Banks, James Charles Murray, Wm. M'Naughton, in the junior.</p>
         <p>Kilwinning, March 30.–The United Associate
                    Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday, the 22d March,
                    and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the
                    congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson, of Dalry, preached
                    and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns, of Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D.
                    Ronald, of Saltcoats, gave the charge to the minister and
                        congregation. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait,
                    of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ;
                    and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed
                    congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of
                    their much esteemed and highly talented young minister.</p>
         <p>Presentation of Plate.–Mr A. S. Walker, late of
                    the Commercial Bank of Scotland, at present manager of the branch of
                    the Commercial Bank of England, at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately
                    presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that
                    establishment, bearing the following inscription :– "Presented
                    to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial
                    Bank of England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and
                    valuable services–March, 1836." This is another proof of
                    the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been
                    trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return, just published, we find that the emigration to Canada
                    has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants
                    landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 and 1832
                    four times, and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12,527,
                    there were 5597 adult males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14
                    years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The
                    numbers from the three kingdoms were– England, 3067
                    Ireland, 7,108 Scotland, 2,127 From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia,
                    &amp;c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 Upper Canada, 9,800
                    Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13 Returned to the United Kingdom, 117
                    Removed to the United States, 300 –12,527</p>
         <p>But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 landed at New York, raising the
                    whole number of emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three
                    vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William
                    Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers, all saved–the
                    barque James from Newfoundland, all saved–and the
                    Nathaniel Graham from Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew,
                    of whom 41 were lost.</p>
         <p>From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 female emigrants were
                    sent out to Australia last year, under the superintendence of the
                    Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The
                        arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality
                    was small, and few complaints were made. The females were
                    all of decent character, and due care was taken on their arrival to get
                    them disposed of as servants, in situations where their morals
                    would not be exposed to unnecessary risk.</p>
         <p>Ulster Railway.–Length 36 miles, from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600,000, in 12,000 shares, of
                    which t393,000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is
                    450,000; the expected income is t93,000, of which t67,800 is from
                    passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539,000. The
                    steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310, 320, and
                    570 yards in length.</p>
         <p>East Lothian Railway.–We call attention
                    with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to
                    Edinburgh, by Haddington and Tranent, which appears in our first page. No
                    one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably
                    it is fitted for this species of communication, by its
                    remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a
                    work would pay, had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an
                    unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of
                    Scotland, from the German ocean to the Atlantic, its chances of success are
                    vastly increased.</p>
         <p>Dundee and Arbroath Railway.–The Committee's report on this railway has reached us, but we must
                    confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90
                    yards ; the capital t100,000, divided into 4000 shares, which is all subscribed, but authority is taken to raise t40,000 more by
                    loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally
                    interested t88,900, by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000
                    and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16,912, goods
                    t14,654, from both t31,566. There are no tunnels, no inclined planes, and
                    the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000, scarcely differs from a dead
                    level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The
                    estimated expenses is t99,844.</p>
         <p>Statute Labour Acts.–It appears from the
                    votes of the House of Commons, that a Select Committee has
                    been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts, and to
                    consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated,
                    that by the present act for this county, proprietors of land, and
                    several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden,
                    on account of the coaches, chaises, gigs, or saddle horses they may keep,
                    though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them
                    as to the occupiers of land, upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In
                    many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road
                    funds, were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is
                    vested in heritors, rated at one hundred pounds Scots and
                    upwards, though it is stated with confidence, that were the occupiers of
                    land included, beneficial consequences would follow.–East-Lothian Correspondent.</p>
         <p>Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society.–
                    The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday
                    last–John Hutton, Esq., one of the Honorary Members, President of
                    the Society, in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was
                    read, and thanks were voted to the different Officebearers. It appears that this society was established under the
                    countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers, and various
                    influential individuals in Leith, and is well deserving of encouragement,
                    as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes,
                    the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds, we
                    understand, are in a prosperous state.</p>
         <p>Hay and Straw.–In consequence of it having been
                    alleged last Wednesday, that higher prices were got for straw than
                    those quoted, we have made due inquiry, and find there are no
                    grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured,
                    that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two
                    years past, the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to
                    favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers, or to favour
                    either party at the expense of the public.</p>
         <p>The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their
                    warrant, dated the 6th of April 1836, a distinguishing flag to be worn by
                    the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of
                    Scotland, viz. a blue cornet flag, with a white St Andrew's cross on the
                    upper quarter on a red field.</p>
         <p>Heriot's Hospital.–At the meeting of the
                    Governors of George Heriot's Hospital, on Thursday the 7th instant,
                    the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel,
                    amounting to t935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of
                    economy to learn, that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority
                    of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous
                    vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, for
                    gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel,
                    which was described by Councillor Grant and others, as highly creditable to
                    the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect.
                    The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for
                    admission of boys, preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There
                    were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus classed
                    :–</p>
         <p>Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital, or any
                    other institution, 12 Those who have received benefit for
                    one child, 13 Do. for two children, 6 Do. for three children, 5
                    Do. for five children, 1 37</p>
         <p>In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to
                    give preference, first to children of widows (being poor), then
                    to those who have never received benefit, afterwards those who
                    have had only one child in, and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children, and one for an orphan, out of
                    the above number, and it is therefore probable, considering the large
                    population of Edinburgh, that it is not sufficiently known, that George
                    Heriot, in his will, expressly points out the fatherless and poor, being children of
                    burgesses and freemen, as the objects of his
                    charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient numbers of really
                    necessitous cases, the Governors, in filling up the vacancies, may elect
                    some that do not appear to have strong claims, simply from those that
                    have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy.–On Thursday last the
                    course of lectures on Political Economy, delivered by Dr Thomas
                    Murray, in Elder Street Chapel, was brought to a conclusion ; on which
                    occasion the thanks of the meeting were, on the motion of one of the members of committe, voted by acclamation to the lecturer for
                    his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr
                    Murray, Mr A. G. Hunter, merchant, was called to the Chair, and some
                    conversation having taken place, the committee of management, who had
                    necessarily been self-elected, were confirmed by the meeting in their
                    office, and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for
                    obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We
                    understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper, some evening
                    next week, on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver
                    plate.</p>
         <p>It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve, Esq. of Newington Cottage,
                    died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance, and
                    his death will be long and deeply regretted.</p>
         <p>Rare Sights in London.–A young Scottish Miss,
                    who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt, returned the
                    other day by one of the steamers, and was met on landing by various members
                    of her family, who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. "
                    Seen !" exclaimed the fair tourist "I have seen such sights ! I saw the TheologicalGarden, and all the wild beasts in't!"</p>
         <p>The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the
                    longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many
                    years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month, and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We
                    understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have visited the theatre during
                    his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal
                    duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and
                    difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello,
                    Shylock, and King John, investing each with its own peculiar charms
                    and interest, and exciting the highest admiration and
                    astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius, which could give
                    such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate
                    classes of characters. The play with which his engagement
                    concluded was Richard, which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was, as usual,
                    crowded in every part, and he exerted himself most strenuously and
                    successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were
                    loud and long, and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from
                    different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for,
                    appeared in front of the stage, and delivered the following very
                    neat and appropriate address:–"Ladies
                        and Gentlemen,–I now stand before you for the last time
                    this season, but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my
                    thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its
                    distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon
                    its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with
                    a heavy, but a grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word–
                    farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic
                    plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive, appears
                    next in Aberdeen, where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his
                    performances. The boxes there, we are told, are already
                    taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey, from the
                    Theatre Royal, Haymarket, makes her appearance here on Monday first.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday evening, Mr John G. Moxey, baker, Castle Street, was
                    entertained at supper, in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern, Waterloo Place, by a
                    party of friends, of about fifty in number, previous to his leaving
                    this country for America, to which he is about to emigrate. The company was
                    very harmonious, and the compliment must have been very gratifying to
                    Mr Moxey.</p>
         <p>Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.–The
                    Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the
                    Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to
                    represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in the parish
                    of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election
                    to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the
                    grounds, as we understand, that he has no domicile within the bounds
                    of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing
                    that his election, though consistent with the letter, is
                    contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal
                    is sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly
                    elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland
                    M'Gill, Esq., that when the commissions came to be attested, he would
                    move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family
                    worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year
                    respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a
                    clerical member had the candour to say, he should wish to know how it
                    was with the ministers themselves in that respect.</p>
         <p>The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of
                    Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton, of Edinburgh. In bestowing this
                    public honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has done so
                    much for the cause of literature and religion, the members of the College
                    have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which
                    will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public
                    of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the
                    public ministrations of Professor Paxton, and even the general church-going
                        community, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence,
                    of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical elegance which
                    have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious
                    body of which he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the most
                    popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology, as
                    Professor to the General Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate
                    Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical
                    study of the Scriptures, and of an unwearied research into the Natural
                    History, and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work
                    by which he is chiefly known as an author– The
                        Illustrations of Scripture–will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning, and of his Oriental
                    investigations, and to his powers of lucid and eloquent
                    composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed
                    to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages.
                    This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of
                    study, reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart
                    of Mr Tennant.</p>
         <p>Public Dinner to Professor Dick.–On Tuesday
                    last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a
                    number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70)
                    from various parts of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public
                    dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. in the Chair, and
                    Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed.
                    Pyper, Esq. of West Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Samuel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, James Miller,
                    Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we
                    observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and
                    Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, Esq. of Coldoch; Charles
                    Gordon, Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &amp;c. The
                    cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank, the chairman,
                    in a neat and appropriate speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to
                    whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour, and
                    who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their
                    admiration as a man of talent, which toast was drank with the greatest
                        enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the
                    Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of
                    Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College, which was followed
                    by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were
                    sung, and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late
                    hour.</p>
         <p>Royal Infirmary–We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal
                    Infirmary have, by their judicious arrangements in the
                    management of the ball, been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that
                    institution, (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432, 7s.
                    8d. The managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at large, are
                    certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that
                    occasion, for their valuable extertions, particularly at the present time,
                    in support of this great and useful institution, for the relief of
                    those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.</p>

      <header>Papers from Madras to...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have been received. Accounts
                    had arrived through Singapore, from the ship Mangles, stating
                    that when passing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's
                    Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part of the crew of the
                    long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, in a state of slavery, but the natives
                    would not deliver up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to have
                    been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, in 1833, in prosecution
                    of her voyage from New South Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence
                    of her fate was previously known. The ironworks which had been erected
                    at Porto Novo were proceeding with activity, and some railing had been made
                    there, quite equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufactured in England.</p>

         <p>Every thing is jobbedFemale Emigration to Australia, &amp;c.(From a Correspondent.)</p>
         <p>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferently managed;
                    and we are glad to find that such a man as Sir John Franklin is appointed
                    to govern Van Diemen's Land; and the sooner an improved system
                    is adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only are men sent out
                    to govern who are ignorant of human nature, a knowledge of which is
                    essential to the management of the heterogenous materials of our
                    penal colonies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes
                    to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our rulers have the
                    sense to see the importance of sending our respectable females to these
                    colonies ; but they trust an Emigration Committee, and this committee
                    trusts individuals who desire to make the most of the concern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of making the
                    public acquainted with the mode in which the business is conducted, in the
                    hope that some humane Member of Parliament will take the subject
                    up. The mode of managing female emigration is this :–</p>
         <p>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a free passage to
                    Australia. A ship is hired, and this ship must ave a full cargo, to satisfy the owners.Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard working
                    females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress makers, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c., with a small mixture of better articles, is made up. But if, as
                    almost always happens, a sufficient number of these to fill the
                    ship does not come forward, a supply of sweepings is taken from a
                    workhouse! Here, then, is such a mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to
                    the amount of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough of evil to
                    corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the poor creatures they are crammed
                        four into onebed !</p>
         <p>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to know the fact, that some
                    young women of respectability who wished to go to New South
                    Wales with theirfriends, were refused a free passage, unless they
                    went to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we see that the
                    interests of agents and shipowners overcomes the interests of
                    the colonies, and actually obstructs the attainment of the
                    object in view. We find blindness a very common ailment in every department
                    of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may be to reform every
                    abuse, and to adopt useful measures, they are often thwarted by
                    the necessity (which ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and
                    leeches, which devour the public substance, and suck the public blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean the outside of the
                    platter ; and it may not reach the inside in our day. It is the duty,
                    however, of all patriots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut
                    out corruption from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of exposure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to
                    support those who are willing to apply it.</p>
         <p>As in a matter of so much importance nothing should be concealed, there is
                    no hesitation in stating that it consists with our knowledge that, after
                    the Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detailing
                    the deplorable consequences of sending out young women from workhouses, a
                    ship has actually sailed, nearly filled up as we have described. When any
                    representation is made to a public office, the matter is said to
                    belong to another department ; and that other department says it is not its
                    province to interfere ; and thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the
                        battledore of jobbing and the blindness of office.</p>
         <p>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the inhuman job will be put
                    an end to.</p>

      <text>
         <p>EmigrationMr Walter moved, pursuant to notice, that "an
                        humble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he
                    will be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard
                    entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the several postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed to put in a
                    conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and to circulate among the
                    clergy and the parochial authorities be withdrawn." He had been assured y
                    several gentlemen who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the
                    young females sent out by the Emigration committee had been
                    irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as obtained services
                    found themselves placed among a very different calss of persons
                    to that which they had been accustomed to mix with in this
                    country. The hon. member read an extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the
                    19th of February last, in which it was stated that some of the females
                    "thus launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thirteen years old.</p>
         <p>Mr Wakley seconded the motion. Sir G. Grey adverted to the extraordinary object of
                    the address, when the information desired had in fact already been
                    given on a former day. He hoped, whatever information, correct
                    or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject of emigration, that the
                    people of England would not adopt their notions from anonymous paragraphs
                    in Hobart Town newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a system in operation by which people were driven out of the
                    country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many
                    slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more unfounded
                    statement than this. Though much good had arisen to the colonies
                    and individuals, yet it could not be denied that, in some instances, youn
                    women had turned out badly They had these facts upon authority–that
                    many of those females obtained respectable places. The names of
                    the individuals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival,
                    the mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers on
                    the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the hon. member and
                    others, when statements relative to emigration were made, to
                    receive them with caution and reserve.</p>
         <p>Mr C. Lushington defended the proceedigs of the Emigration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the greatest
                    posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) He would then ask of any
                    one to look at the names of the gentlemen who were on that
                    committee–to look at their characters; and could any one
                    who did so believe that the members of that committee would be guilty of
                    the sin of sendng out, day after day, young females to the
                    colonies–of thus duping those unprotected creatures to their
                    destruction? (hear, hear.)</p>
         <p>Mr Walter replied. He had not relied for his statements upon newspapers, but upon official documents.</p>
         <p>The motion was negatived without a division.</p>

      <header>State of Trade The Wool...</header>
      <text>
         <p>State of Trade.</p>
         <p>The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening.–The
                        following are more accurate averages of the sales of
                    Colonial Wools which have recently taken place than we were enabled to
                        obtain during their progress.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The Wools have become
                    much improved in growth, in length of staple, in management, and in
                    washing. The market being very bare in combining wool, this description
                    realized a proportionate advance. Several flocks attracted great
                    attention, particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, which
                    show that great pains have been paid by the growers upon them. The correct
                    averages obtained are as follows :–</p>
         <p>Van Diemen's Land.</p>
         <p>s. d. s. d. Choice flocks T A in a square 2 9 to 3 1 per lb. Do. I X 2
                    0 1/2 2 9 Do. Y 1 8 2 9 Good flocks 2 2 3/4 2 9 1/2 Ordinary and
                    fair quality 1 4 1/2 2 2 1/2 Inferior and in the great 1 2 1 4</p>
         <p>Australian</p>
         <p>Good flocks 2 6 2 9 Fair 2 3 1/2 2 5 Inferior 1 11 2 2 and in the
                    grease 1 3</p>
         <p>The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a considerable
                    rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same flocks then selling
                    only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.</p>
         <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have been 2300 bales,
                    of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spanish, 300 New South
                    Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Turkey, and 500 bales of South
                    American Woo's.</p>
         <p>Huddersfield, Tuesday.–There has been no visible
                    change in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks.
                    Business in general is pretty good.</p>
         <p>Bradford, June 30.–The activity we have so often
                    had to report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six
                    quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is particularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the
                    yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the better. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very little
                    disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, although the
                    demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers are rather firmer. The
                    Liverpool sales of New South Wales Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the
                    recent London sales.</p>
         <p>Rochdale, June 27.–The market this week was very
                    well attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much
                    in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally good at
                    present, and building is going on to a very considerale extent.</p>
         <p>York Wool Market, June 30.–The quantity of wool
                    brought to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last
                    week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a considerable
                    portion of business was done, and last week's quotations were fully
                    supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to
                    17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without cots 10 1/2 to 11 1/2d ;
                    ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.</p>

                    contains 131 emigrants of the following descriptions: 37 young

      <header>South AustraliaWe have received...</header>
      <text>
         <p>South Australia</p>
         <p>We have received the first annual Report of new
                    colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper presented in June last.
                    The site selected for the colony is a part of the south coast of New
                    Holland, extending two or three hundred miles on each side of
                    Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. It was
                    anticipated that the best central station would be Port Lincoln at the
                    entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north
                    coast of Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and east
                    longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from Sydney, the same distance
                    north-west from Van Diemen's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward
                    of the colony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about
                    100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is established under
                    Parliamentary Commissioners, as an experiment, we believe, to try whether
                    it may not be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration
                    without any charge to the country, by selling lots of land at such a
                    price as would defray the expense of conveying the emigrants from England.
                    The plan adopted is, to send out preferably young married persons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts into the colony. A
                    company has embarked t35,000 in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent
                    out in March to examine the coast carefully, that the best site might
                    be chosen at first, and the necessity of removal avoided. Six
                    vessels altogether had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male
                    labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 females of a
                    superior class. These numbers include 26 children. The Commissioners
                    attempted at first to get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it
                        impossible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at
                    this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country section
                    of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they had raised the t35,000
                    required by the act of Parliament as the condition of the grant
                    of land. We give these few details to put our readers in a condition to
                    understand the notices which appear from time to time in the papers
                    respecting the colony. We hope the Commissioners or the adventurers will
                    give the country a distinctive name. The title of "South Australia" is
                    bad any way, and even positively absurd ; since Australia (quasi Australasia,) originally intended for New
                    Holland, has already begun to be monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The
                    district at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general
                    denomination, should be termed "North" rather than "South" Australia.
                    By the way, most of our colonies in that quarter of the world have
                    ridiculous names, as is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for
                    the people out of them. What can be worse than a "Van Diemen-lander ;"
                    a "New South-Wales-ian ;" a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Soundian ! !"</p>

                    salary of t150, and if five hundred, a salary of t200. Already nine

      <header>Highland Emigrants –The ship "...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Highland Emigrants.–The ship " Midlothian" has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception
                    of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the Isle of Skye for
                    Sydney, New South Wales. These emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out
                    at a very small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the passage
                    money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of New South Wales,
                    which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and
                        promotion of emigration–the objects in view being, as
                    well the relief of those districts in this country which are suffering
                    from the want of employment and subsistence, as by the introduction into
                    that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals, the promotion of the moral welfare of
                    the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we believe, receive
                    employment in New South Wales as farm-servants, shepherds, overseers,
                    &amp;c. We had a brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday afternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted up
                    in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be
                    effected. She sails this afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.</p>

      <header>Thus the British Government...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Thus the British Government is multiplying its colonies round the
                    shores of New Holland. Exclusive of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a
                    separate island, we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of
                    Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, 500 miles
                    south from Sidney ; a third just described, at St. Vincent's Gulf, 500
                    miles west from Port Philip ; a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles
                    west from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 miles north
                    from King George's South. All these colonies are in the temperate zone,
                    between the latitudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the
                    same climate. We had one at Melville Island, on the north coast,
                    within the torried zone, in latitude 12 ; but it was found to be very
                    unhealthy, and was abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
         <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as hitherto explored, is one of
                    the most barren and unpromising lands in the world, there is a
                    margin of good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale [?]
                    of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty millions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in the course of
                    three centuries, it will be the seat of a great and powerful nation,
                    cultivating the arts, and speaking the language of Britain, and
                    contributing powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern
                    Hemisphere.</p>

      <header>EmigrationThe Annual Report on...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Emigration</p>
         <p>The Annual Report on Emigration just issued
                    contains, besides the usual, correspondences and documents connected
                    with the plan which has been some time in operation, of transferring
                    labourers from India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed to
                    extend to New South Wales. Leaving this subjest for the present,
                    we shall state the general results[?] of the emigration to Canada.</p>
         <p>The Report shows, that the whole number of emigrants who landed at Quebec or
                    Montreal, in the last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly
                    29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration were 1831 and 1832,
                    the numbers for these years being respectively 50,254 and
                    51,746. The proportions[?] [?] furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine
                    years were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were five
                    Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. Scotland in proportion to its
                    population has sent off three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about
                    nine times as may as England; and it should be added, that a certain
                    part of the emigration from England is artificial, consisting of paupers
                    sent out at the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the most
                    natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a country of its
                    redundant or unemployed population ; and it may be asked, why it is so much
                    less resorted to in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?]
                    be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead to the inference
                    that the Irish, who emigrate in the largest numbers, were the best informed
                    of the three nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor Laws,
                    which hold out to the labourer the certainty of a subsistence at home,
                    however idle or improvident he may be, and render him averse to live in the
                        colonies, where he would have no such resource. This is
                    only one of the many evils which these laws have produced, not only to the country at large, but to the labouring classes themselves, whose average condition was greatly
                    deteriorated, while only a fraction of their number shared the benefit of
                    the allowance. We speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act
                    of 1834 was passed.</p>
         <p>The number of emigrants who went to Canada last year was 21,901, of whom
                    1399 went from Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from Ireland, and
                    274 from Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, or the West Indies. In 1836
                    the number of emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from which
                    the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of
                    the emigrants in 1837, 4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper
                        Canada, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two
                    died in the hospital or quarantine station.</p>
         <p>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British emigrants have landed
                    at new York, or fully 26,000 per annum on average. There is a great
                    fluctua-[?] tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only 16,000 ;
                    in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than 59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728
                    who went to Canada, no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New
                    York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. There is a discrepancy,
                    however, between this account and another in a different Return, also newly
                        published. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emigration," makes the number who went to the United States
                    from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The former probably
                    comprehends all British born subjects, including persons from Nova Scotia,
                    Canada, and the West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of whom
                    returned.</p>
         <p>The Agent-General gives the number of persons who emigrated to the British
                    Colonies and the United States for every year since 1825. We present merely
                    the average for the last year seven years.</p>
         <p>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to North American Colonies, 39[?],00
                    Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope,
                    20[?] Ditto do. to Australian Colonies, 3[?]0 73[?],[?]</p>
         <p>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colonies was no less
                    than 103,140. The number who went out to Australia in 1837, was much
                    greater than in any preceding year, being 5054.</p>
         <p>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his passage, &amp;c., or
                    has in his pocket t30, the average net[?] expended on emigration will be
                    about two millions per annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human
                    beings form no inconsiderable item, in number and
                    value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we suppose it
                    is by far the most flourishing, and by no means the least advantageous
                    branch of the national commerce.</p>
         <p>The annual increment of the population of British Isles is about 330,000,
                    independently of the efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be
                    about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] more inhabitants in
                    the country each day than there were on the day before. Of the 1150
                    additional mortals[?] emigration carries off 200.</p>
         <p>The establishment of steam navigation across the Atlantic will, no doubt,
                    give a new impulse to the circulation of human beings, while the
                    construction of railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada,
                    will greatly increase the capacity of the western world to absorb the
                    imported multitudes. In seven years hence, the journey from London to
                    Missouri will be shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the
                    journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years ago. A religious
                    man might see something like the finger of Providence in the fact, that
                    just at the time France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland,
                    begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant population, inventions have started into existence which may be said to
                    annihilate space, and bring the most thinly inhabited parts of the world,
                    into juxtaposition with the most overpeopled.</p>
         <p>From the American Almanac, we find that the number of passengers
                    who arrived in the United States in 1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were
                    native Americans. The proportion of emigrants from the different
                    foreign countries was–</p>
         <p>From the British Isles, 47,792 ... British American Colonies, 2,681 ...
                    Germany, 20,142 ... France, 4,443 ... Prussia, 563 ...
                    Switzerland, 465 ... Denmark, 414 ... Holland, 298 ... Mexico,
                    797 ... Texas, 698 ... Cuba, 516 ... Other countries, 2,152</p>
         <p>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this table, as to the motives
                    which induce men to leave their native country. Celeris
                        paribus, there is most emigration where there is most
                    intelligence. Thus, Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States,
                    and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while Britain and
                    Germany furnish a vast number. Much, however, must depend on the domestic
                    condition of the country, and on the greater or less facilities for
                    removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and the small number
                    of its inhabitants, the spirit of emigration must be much more
                    active in Switzerland, which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which
                    sends out 4443.</p>
         <p>The magistrates of New York, it appears, consider the influx of
                    emigrants a nuisance, and it would seem, from an expression of Mr
                    Buchanan's, the agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dollars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. The
                    key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in the following facts. A
                    Board of Aldermen reported in June last, that the expense of City
                    Almshouses in the preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or t44,000 ; that
                    of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were aliens ; and
                    that the whole number under the charge of the Commissioners was 3074, of
                    whom three-fourths were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor at
                    the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive each week ; our
                    streets are filled with the wandering crowds of those passengers,
                    clustering in our city, unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without
                    employment, without friends, many not speaking our language, without
                    any dependence for food, or rainment[?], or fireside." In Boston and
                    Philadelphia, also, nearly one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were
                        foreigners.</p>

         <p>Emigration to Australia.–Several vessels
                    have sailed within the last three weeks for our settlements
                    in the souther hemisphere, with full cargoes of goods, and a large number
                    of passengers. The South Australian packet-ship Orleana, will carry out nearly 250 passengers. Many of the

         <p>General Flinter.–We are sorry to learn, by
                    our letters from Madrid, that a very brave and deserving
                    officer, General Flinter, committed suicide on the 9th instant in that
                    city. General Flinter was an Irishman of good family. He served
                    under the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain, and was one of the
                    many officers who joined the Portuguese and Spanish armies by

      <text>
         <p>The King of Prussia and his Catholic Sub-jects.–The German
                        Courier in an article dateBerlin, 5th instant, refers to the late arrests in Posen, and accuses
                    the Catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt. The Prussian
                    Government had, in consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the
                    Court of Rome, in hopes that its influence would be exercised over the
                    clergy, and induce them to return to their allegiance. On the other hand,
                    the sect of Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria to
                    Australia, because of the interference of Government with their
                    religious belief, amounted to 40,000 souls. It was said they would be
                    joined by a great number of the inhabitants of Pomerania.</p>

      <header>Commission of the General...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Commission of the General Assembly</p>
         <p>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in the Tolbooth
                    Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the chair.</p>
         <p>The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales.–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commission, that on a former meeting, they had directed him to write to Lord
                    Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, disavowing connection with Dr Lang in
                    New South Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in
                    separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in connection with
                    the Church of Scotland. Since that time he had had a communication from
                    Lord Glenelg, which he was sure would be received by the Commission with great satisfaction.</p>
         <p>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then read. It consisted of a copy of
                    the despatch transmitted to the Governor of New South Wales,
                    approving of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Presbyterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to the
                    authority of the Presbytery in connection with the Church of Scotland, and
                    further directing that Dr Lang's salary should be discontinued. His
                    lordship explained, that in doing this the Government had no wish to
                    constitute themselves judges in any ecclesiastical disputes ;
                    but as the salaries awarded to these gentlemen had been given on the faith
                    that they were to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland,
                    they could not be continued so long as they defied her authority.</p>
         <p>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission unanimously expressed
                    their satisfaction with the promptitude and decision which the
                    Government had shown in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to communicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed to
                    re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther proceedings, especially
                    as it was understoof that Dr Lang was now on his way to this country.</p>
         <p>Case of Small Isles.–The Commission, then proceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will
                    be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean having, as
                    was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the Assembly House, while
                    that Court was sitting in May last, in a state of intoxication. The case
                    occupied the Court a considerable part of the day; and at the evening
                    sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was unanimously agreed to–That the Commission having considered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far as that evidence
                    is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find it proved that on the afternoon of
                    Friday the 25th of May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication
                    in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting to force his way
                    into it; that it is proved he was on two other occasions during the sitting
                    of last Assembly in a state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that
                    he ought to be deposed from the office of the holy ministry, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce the sentence of
                    deposition, directing the Clerk to transmit an extract of the
                    sentence to the Presbytery of Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small
                    Isles vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair the
                    sentence os deposition.</p>
         <p>Case of Lethendy.–In the course of the
                        proceedings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the
                    Procurator rose and said, he might take the present opportunity of
                    stating to the Commission, that within the last three or four days a
                    petition and complaint had been given in to the Court of Session, and
                    appointed to be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the
                    parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Mr Kessen,
                    whom that Presbytery had lately inducted into that charge, in
                    despite of interdicts issued by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact
                    to that Commission, presuming that they would authorize him to defend
                    the Presbytery, who had acted under authority of the Commission
                    itself.</p>
         <p>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in commendation of the firmness
                    of the Presbytery in carrying through the settlement amidst many
                    difficulties, moved that "The Commission sanction the Procurator's defending the Presbytery in the trying circumstances in which
                    they are placed, and resolve that they will to the utmost of their power
                    encourage and support them under whatsoever difficulties they may be
                    subjected by their execution of the sentence of the Commission ; and that
                    the thanks of the Commission be given to the Presbytery for the
                    decision and temperate firmness with which they have practically
                    maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of the Church."</p>
         <p>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any motion on this
                    subject; but with the views which he entertained in regard to
                    this case, it was impossible he could concur in the motion proposed, and he
                    must therefore dissent from it.</p>
         <p>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against Mr Clark for thus
                    bidding defiance to the authority of the Church Courts, and he proposed,
                    that for thus trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr
                    Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission for an
                    exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, that although he
                    concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, it would be premature at present to
                    take any steps against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official
                    communication on the subject from the Presbytery of Dunkeld.</p>
         <p>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this reason, not to press his
                    motion, declaring, that as at this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had
                    been deposed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr
                    Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; and Mr M.
                    said emphatically, that whatever the Presbytery of Dunkeld might
                    suffer for upholding the independence of the Church, he, as a
                    member of Commission, by whose orders they had acted, would be
                    proud to bear his share.</p>
         <p>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive pressing his motion, and Mr
                    Buchanan's was adopted, Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their
                    dissent, on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient for the
                    Commission to adopt such a resolution.</p>
         <p>Commemoration of the Second Centenary of theCelebrated Assembly at Glasgow.–In the
                    course of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was the
                    second centenary of the great Assembly at Glasgow, which might
                    be considered as the founder, not only of their ecclesiastical but of their
                    civil liverties, a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer
                    and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits conferred
                    on their Zion.</p>
         <p>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the members, and a
                    considerable number of people assembled, when an hour was spent in
                    devotional exercises, which were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson,
                    in succession.</p>
         <p>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in February next.</p>

                    emigrants to New Zealand, under the auspices of a company formed in
                    this country, will sail in about a fortnight. She is called the Tory, and measures about 480 tons. A dejeuner was given on Saturday by the proprietors on

         <p>Daryanthus Excelsa–This most magnificent
                    and gigantic plant is now in full bloom in one of the hothouses at
                    Dunkeld gardens. It is a native of New South Wales, and to be met with in
                    this country in very few collections–this being the third plant of
                    the kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of the four
                    plants which were sent from New Holland to the Duchess of Atholl, twelve
                    years ago, and the only one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or
                    stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top of which diverge
                    seven stalks, each bearing nine large flowers of a deep crimson and pink
                    colour. The formation of the stalks and outer petals of the
                    flower, remind one of the Crinum Amabile, but much larger.
                    We had no communication as a guide to its culture, but kept it at all
                    times, and in all season, associated with the most hardy
                        green-houseplants.–DunkeldGardens, 24th May.</p>

         <p>Collision at Sea.–We are sorry to learn
                    that the fine new ship Palmyra, which sailed from Greenock
                    on her first voyage for Sydney, New South Wales, on Wednesday week, having
                    a large number of respectable emigrants on board, came in
                    dreadful collision when at sea, on Sunday evening, with another
                    vessel, and had her bulwark driven in and some of the masts
                    dismantled, but providentially no lives were lost. She was towed back to
                    Greenock on Wednesday morning, and the utmost exertions are
                    making for her re-sailing from Greenock early next week.</p>

         <p>Emigration to South Australia,–On Saturday last, about twenty-five persons, male and female, left

                    her Majesty's Colonisation Commissioners for South Australia, and sailed
                    that afternoon from Leith to London, to be there embarked on board the
                    Lloyds, and were to sail for their adopted land on Thursday last. Their

         <p>Meeting on Emigration in Dublin.–One of
                    the largest and msot influential meetings that we ever remember, says
                    the Dublin Monitor of Thursday, took place on
                    Wednesday, at the Rotunda, to form an Association for the
                    Promotion of Emigration to South Australia. In rank and numbers it was not
                    surpassed. There could not be less than two thousand persons in the
                    room. Colonel Torrens dwelt at considerable length on the causes of Irish
                    misery, and proved fully, at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and
                        efficacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the
                    meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on the meeting ; the
                    speakers were heard with great attention, and the applauses they
                    received told that the public feeling was deeply identified with the future
                    colony of New Ireland.</p>

         <p>Australia.–The splendid ship Superb,
                    Captain Shannon, 1000 tons burthen, left Greenock on Saturday morning last, with 160 passengers and a valuable cargo of goods. A
                    very considerable number of the passengers were from East Lothian, who all
                    expressed themselves highly gratified with their accommodation. The
                    owners, Messrs Andrew Steward &amp; Co., spared no expense which might add
                    to the comfort of the emigrants ; and the kind of attentions of Mr Adamson,
                    Colonization Company's agent, were much appreciated by them all

      <text>
         <p>A Man Shot.–On Tuesday evening a deliverate
                    attempt at murder by shooting took palce at Greenock. A young man from
                    Edinburgh, an intended emigrant for New South Wales, by the Palmyra, drew
                    from his pocked a pistol, and shot in the head a person who had been
                    appointed by his friends to see him on board, and to look to his affairs
                    before the sailing of the vessel. The wounded man was taken to the
                    Infirmary in a very dangerous state, and the assailant to the jail. It
                    appears that the young man has for some time past been behaving in a manner
                    which made his friends chary of intrusting him with money in this country,
                    and that they had employed the individual referred to, to see him on
                    board for Australia, before leaving any under his charge. This indignity is
                    supposed to have lain heavy on his mind, and led to the commission of
                    the act above recorded.–Ibid.</p>

         <p>First Scotch Colony for New Zealand– A
                    numerous party of emigrants, under this title, are now making the necessary
                    arrangements for embarking in the Bengal Merchant, to sail from
                    Greenock in September. The committee for the west of Scotland, and their agents, are now employed in selecting eligible persons as
                    settlers, and, judging from the number of applications, the directors will
                    be called on to send a second vessel from the Clyde. A clergyman of the Scotch Church, who accompanies the colony, will officiate as
                    chaplain on board. It is intended that the Clude shall be made
                    the principal shipping port of Scotland for New Zealand, and that the
                    strictest regulations shall be put in force in order to ensure the comfort,

         <p>Selected Poetry</p>
         <p>The Woodland,By the Late Robert Nicoll.</p>
         <p>The woodland wild ! – wilt thou go with me, Where the squirrel is
                    perchen on his oaken tree,– where the yellow fern doth wave its
                    head,– Where the hands of night the dew hath laid,– And
                    the winds, that wander to and fro, Kiss the brown leaflets as they
                    go,– Where the morning sun peeps in, so mild, To the dark green
                    nooks of the woodland wild ? The woodland wild ! –where the dun deer
                    roam, And the song-birds build them a happy home,– Where the
                    grass is green, and the turf so sweet, Seems shorn by the tread of fairy
                    feet,– Where the daylight comes, so richly dim, And the
                    cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn, The care-worn heart might be
                    self-beguiled To forget its woes in the woodland wild ! The woodland
                    wild ! –where the hazels grow, Where the ladye-broom doth its
                    branches throw,– Where the God-built sky is in patches seen
                    Through the roof of leaves. There aye hath been The home of those wild
                    and fairy flowers That gladden all Nature's life and ours, As they
                    bloom by the stream,–that prattling child, That wanders along
                    through the woodland wild ! The woodland wild !–If thy heart be
                    pure, If thy faith in the right be firm and sure, Go, wander the
                    woodlands parth within, And the love of Nature woo and win; Drink of
                    the cup of beauty there, Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air;
                    For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled On the sweet green bowers
                    of the woodland wild The woodlan wild !–long, long ago, I have
                    buried myself its leaves below, And dreamed of its beauteous tenants
                    all,– 'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! 'Tis the spot
                    where the wondrous monk of old, His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold;
                    By its door a crystal springlet boiled, For the pilgrim to drink, in
                    the woodlan wild! The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories
                    Make sunlight over its olden glories,– Of Robin Hood and his
                    bowmen bold, The raids they made, and the tales they told ! In winter,
                    in spring, and in summer time, The glorious forests are aye in prime ;
                    For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, Those grassy glades in
                    the woodland wild! The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste!
                    Away with me, and its gladness taste; We will wander beside each
                    gushing stream, Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; We will
                    follow its paths and pluck its flowers, And lie on its grass in the evening
                    hours, Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, Warns us away from the
                    woodland wild ! Tail's Magazine</p>
         <p>Song of the Emigrants to New ZealandSteer, helmsman, till you steer our way By
                    stars beyond the line– We go to found a realm–one day–
                    Like England's self to shine. Chorus.Cheer up ! Cheer up! our course we'll keep With dauntless heart and
                    hand, And when we've ploughed the stormy deep We'll plough a smiling
                    land. A land whose beauties importune The Briton to its bowers,
                    To sow but plenty's seeds and prune Luxuriant fruits and flowers,

         <p>Leith</p>
         <p>Thursday afternoon the splendid ship Indus, which
                    has been some time in the docks, sailed with a full cargo and about sixty
                    settlers, for Port Adelaide and Philip, South Australia. The Indus has been
                    fitted up in that style of elegance and comfort, for which the agents,
                    Messrs Broadfoot and Son, are so celebrated. The passengers consist of a
                    number of respectable individuals of various professions, the greater
                    bulk of whom are agricultural labourers, sent out by Messrs Adamson and
                    Co., agents for her Majesty's Commissioners in South
                    Australia.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday forenoon a man fell from the deck of the Royal William
                    steam-ship, and had his thighbone broken, and was otherwise
                    seriously bruised. He was carried to the Dispensary Rooms, but upon
                    examining the nature of his injuries, the medical attendants recommended his removal to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.</p>

         <p>Church in New South Wales.–Dr Gordon, as
                    Convener of the committee to whom the dissensions that at present
                    existed among the Presbyterian churches in Australia had been remitted by
                    last Commission, stated that the Committee had prepared a report
                    ; but that since it was made up, several important documents had come
                    to hand, which, in justice to Dr Lang, ought to be considered. He therefore
                    asked leave to delay the report, and to have the matter, with these documents, recomitted to the committee.–This motion was
                    agreed to, on the understanding that the question would be again taken up
                    at the meeting of the Commission on the 11th December.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Afflicting Case of Destitution.–Some
                    time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port for Australia,
                    and to take out Government settlers free of expense. A family in Shetland,
                    consisting of the husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their
                    effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing themselves of
                    this opportunity to settle in the above colony. On applying to the agent,
                    however, they were informed that they did not come under the description
                    of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have lived in Leith till
                    their little all has been exhausted, and the husband, from the combined
                    effects of disappointment and want, has been thrown upon a
                    sick-bed, and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation.
                    Several private individuals, with a benevolence that does them the
                    highest credit, have temporarily supplied their wants ; but the
                    hands of private charity is soon crippled, and unless something else be
                        immediately done, we may have soon to report one or more of
                    their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of life. The
                    object of the present notice therefore is to draw forth the sympathies of
                    the charitable, to relive a family thus suddenly involved in want and
                    misery, who, from their industrious habits and every way excellent
                    characters, left their native home with the good wishes of all their
                    friends. Any donations, either in money or clothes, will be thankfully
                    received by Mr Andrew Spence, of the firm of Messrs Cunninham &amp; Spence,

                    to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the purpose of
                    petitioning her Majesty and both Houses of Parliament " to adopt prompt and
                    efficient measures for preserving from invasion or abandonment the longestablished sovereignty of the British Crown in the islands
                    of New Zealand, at present endangered by foreign pretensions, and by the
                    acts of the Executive Government ; also for stopping the course
                    of lawless emigration and settlement, which has not only proved
                    deeply injurious to the native people of the country, but threatens
                    their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, for establishing the most
                    beneficial system of colonization, and the protection and
                    restraints of British law, under a distinct colonial government, in place
                    of the state of anarchy which now prevails among both races, and all
                    other classes of her Majesty's subjects, and others inhabiting or resorting
                    to New Zealand, as a distant independency of the territory of New South
                    Wales." Including the gentlemen of the hustings, the entire number
                    might be calculated at 400 individuals. The Lord Mayor took the
                    chair. Resolutions in accordance with the object of the meeting
                    were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P., Mr F. Baring, M.P., Mr
                    Hawes, M.P., Mr G. F. Young, Mr Ward, M.P., and others. On the motion of Mr G. Robinson, seconded by Mr Donaldson, a
                    petition was adopted by the meeting, to be presented to the Queen by the
                    Earl of Devon, to the House of Peers by Lord Ashburton, and to the Commons
                    by Lord Eliot.</p>

      <text>
         <p>New Zealand–Name of the Capital City.?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Wellington to
                    learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand Company have resolved that the
                    name of the city founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, Port
                    Nicholson, and which is destined to become the capital of New Zealand,
                    shall be named "The City of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke.
                    The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to him the
                    promoters of colonization of South Australia were in a great
                    measure indebted for securing the enactment of the statute which gave
                    effect to the principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many
                    of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Directors of the New Zealand Company, they have resolved,
                    setting all party politics aside, to confer this honour on the
                    Duke. There could be no stronger proof of the political sagacity and
                    statesmanlike views of the Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system
                    of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating his name than by
                    bestowing it on the metropolis of the "Great Britain of the Southern
                    Hemisphere."</p>

         <p>Deputation of Distressed Weavers.–The
                    distress of the Paisley weavers has caused them to send a deputation
                    to London, which, on Tuesday, waited on Lord John Russell, to solicit the
                    means of transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country which
                    has been enriched by their toils, and, in return, refuses them the means of
                    subsistence. Their prayer was to be sent to New Zealand. The answer was,
                    that Government will, next session, bring forward some general measure
                    on the subject, but in the mean time cannot help them.</p>

         <p>Literature</p>
         <p>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick
                    Debell Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: Richard Bentley.</p>
         <p>We have been somewhat disappointed in these volumes. We expected to have
                    found them, like Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding
                    whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on the subject
                    throughout the whole of the first volume, and very little in the
                    second ; in fact, what there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary
                        appendix. This is the more strange, that one of the
                    chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs us, in undertaking
                    this voyage, was to investigate the anatomy and habits of southern whales,
                    and the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, subjects which, he
                    remarks, were then untouched by the literature of any country. Yet, in the
                    work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one of very secondary
                    prominence. This, the readers of the work, at least most of them, will the
                    more regret, on finding how very curious and interesting
                    are the two or three chapters which the author has given on the subject of
                    South Sea whaling. There are full of entertaining details of both a
                    popular and scientific character, and cannot be read without exciting
                    a wish that larger portion of the work had been composed of such
                    material.</p>
         <p>In making these remarks, however, we are far from intending to depreciate
                    the sort of information, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the
                    South Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the volumes
                    are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that it is not what we expected from
                    the title of the work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, we
                    should have preferred. Yet are these sketches very amusing
                    reading–full of graphic descriptions and curious details of native
                    character, which is still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of
                    very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently seen," says Mr Bennett,
                    " amongst the congregagation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a
                    native clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a beaver hat
                    surmounting a person naked except the scanty maro ; and a third, whose
                    whole attire was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"</p>
         <p>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted by Mr Bennett. He says that the "
                    temperate ships" of America are the principal purveyors of ardent
                    spirits to the natives of the South Sea Islands, carrying large quantities
                    of rum thither for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the
                    temperance principle in a somewhat curious predicament.</p>
         <p>Another remark of the author's not less striking–mark it
                    well and take comfort from it ye bon vivants[?] of
                    the civilzed world–is, that disease is as abundant amongst the
                    native islanders as amongst the most refined of their species, and from
                    this concludes, that man in his savage state is as liable to the "
                    ills that flesh is heir to," as in his civilised condition. Dr Johnson made
                    a similar remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; alleging that
                    the London alderman lived as long over his turtle feast, as the Highlander
                    over his paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with civic
                    dignitary and his good living, or whether any, dictated this remark of the
                    learned doctor, we cannot say.</p>
         <p>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, and in style whose only
                    fault is exhibited in a tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather
                    learned phraseology.</p>
         <p>We conclude with an extract from that portion of the work which, from its
                    great interest, we regretted was not larger, but which, limited as it
                    is, is so full of curious information, and so crowded with remarkable
                    incident, as to render the selection by no means an easy task.</p>
         <p>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ their tail when attacked, but
                    prove active and dangerous with their jaws. Such individuals
                    often rather seek than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them
                    with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush them with their
                    teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes continue in their neighbourhood,
                    biting the wreck and oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a
                    boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, and will
                    sometimes act in a very sluggish and unaccountable manner,
                    keeping its formidable lower jaw suspended for some moments over the boat,
                    in a threatening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side,
                    and closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe this
                    whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth in an expanded state
                    for some minutes together. Such threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as
                    well as some others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's crew
                    to leap into the water, and support themselves by swimming or clinging to
                    oars until the danger has passed.</p>
         <p>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered a fighting whale, which
                    after injuring and driving off her four boats, pursued them to the ship,
                    and withstood for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from
                    the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to retire ; in this
                    affair a youth in one of the boats was destroyed by a blow from the whale,
                    and one of the officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact
                    with the animal's jaw.</p>
         <p>"A highly tragical instances of the power and ferocity
                    occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is recorded in the
                    fate of the American South-Seaman Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel,
                    when cruising in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was
                    wrecked by a whale under the following extraordinary circumstances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a school of whales, and
                    the ship was attending them to windward. The master and second mate were
                    engaged with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the school,
                    and the chief mate had returned on board to equip a spare boat, in lieu of
                    his own, which had been broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew
                    were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead reported
                    that a large whale was coming rapidly down upon the ship, the mate hastened
                    his task, in the hope that he might be ready in time to attack it.</p>
         <p>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, consequently a
                    male, and probably the guardian of the school, in the meanwhile approached
                    the ship so closely, that the although the helm was put up to avoid the
                        contact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a
                    portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then observed
                    to retire to some distance, and again rush upon the ship with extreme
                    velocity. His enormous head struck the starboard bow, beating in a
                    corresponding portion of the planks, and the people on board had
                    barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled with water
                    and fell over on her side. She did not sink, however, for some hours ; and
                    the crew in the boats continued near the wreck until they had obtained a
                    small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course for land ; but
                    here, it is to be regretted, they made a fatal error. At the time the
                    accident happened they were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of
                    about 118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society Islands on
                    their lee, and might have sailed in their boats to either of those groups
                    in a comparatively short time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that
                    all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race of people, they
                    preferred pulling to windward for the coast of Peru, and in the attempt
                    were exposed for a lengthened period in extreme privations."</p>
         <p>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as animals dangerous to attack.
                    One was thus distinguished on the cruising ground off the coast
                    of New Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name of 'New
                    Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of great size, conspicuously
                    distinguished by a white hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made
                    amongst the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. A
                    second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to whalers in the Straits
                    of Timor. He had so often succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as
                    to be considered invincible, but was at length despatched by a whaler,
                    who, forewarned of his combative temper, adopted the expedient of floating
                    a cask on the sea, to withdraw his attention from the boats ; but
                        notwithstanding this ruse the animal
                    was not destroyed without much hard fighting, nor until the bow
                    of one of the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."</p>

         <p>(From the Glasgow Argus.)</p>
         <p>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly composed of the working
                    classes, was held in the Justiciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the
                    purpose of memorializing Lord John Russell in favour of
                    obtaining the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded to
                    excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that the Chartists had
                    mustered in great strength to carry out their usual course of obstruction
                    to the particular business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed
                    a resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand through the medium
                    of funds raised by the sale of lands in the colony, and addressed the
                    meeting at some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm,
                    jun. a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long speech,
                    proposed an amendment; to the effect that while the meeting was favourable
                    to emigration to New Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so
                    disposed, they objected to any application being made for a grant of
                    public money for any such purpose–that they were opposed
                    to the question of emigration being allowed to occupy public
                    attention, &amp;c. and concluded with the statement that emigration
                    would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed operatives,
                    and that bad laws were the chief cause of all their present sufferings,
                    &amp;c. This amendment which was supported by the most trifling arguments
                    we ever heard brought forward in public, was of course loudly cheered
                    by the Chartists. The Lord Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed
                    to take the chair on the understanding that the subject of emigration
                    to New Zealand was to occupy the attention ; but here a matter,
                    perfectly foreign to the business for which they were convened,
                    was introduced by way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon the
                    general policy of the country–and he had positively to
                    state that, if such an amendment was carried, he would not remain in the
                    chair. This was received by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion,
                    one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling alternately
                    during the greater part of the evening. A discussion followed, in which a
                    boy named Jack took a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that
                    the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the subject they had
                    the impudence to discuss. It was gravely and indignantly averred, that by
                    going to New Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of being
                    swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the contrary, the Chartists seemed
                    to think that the means of emigration were to be supplied from the public
                        exchequer ; and when told that the funds were to be
                    raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of them sagely
                    observed that it would be much more humane and just to appropriate the
                    proceeds of those sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants !
                    Another favourite argument was, that every person had a right to
                    subsist in the land that gave him birth, and that it was barbarous and
                    cruel to send a man, however wretched, out of his native country ;
                    also, that emigration would produce no benefit to society at home, as the
                    places of those sent off would soon be filled by others. Of course, if
                    these arguments had always been held good, and acted upon, the whole human
                    family would, to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle of
                    our race in the East, provided only the thing had been possible; the
                    extension of mankind to other parts of the world must have been wicked, and
                    cruel, and useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is
                    entitled to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, on
                    his removal to another land, his place would just be filled by others ! The
                    above is a mere specimen of the worse than childish arguments used by the
                    Chartist spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking loudly at
                    the door of the constitution for admission," cheered as if they had been
                    fraught with the choicest wisdom !–Mr John Crawford, Secretary to
                    the New Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible remarks,
                    to place the question of emigration to New Zealand on its proper footing ;
                    but in vain ; they were determined to have the charter only–and till
                    then starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, must starve
                    on. On a division, the amendment proposed by Mr Malcolm was
                    carried by a large majority, and, after a vote of thanks had been given to
                    the Lord Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, however,
                    till the Chartists were called upon to be at their posts at the meeting to
                    be held to-day to address the Queen–to render themselves, of course,
                    a little more odious by another stretch of their obstructive
                    power–if they can.</p>

      <header>On Monday a discussion...</header>
      <text>
         <p>On Monday a discussion of some interest took place in the House of
                    Commons relative to the affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain defects in its government, that colony has fallen into a
                    state of financial embarassment requiring immediate relief. Lord John
                    Russell traced the history of the settlement from its foundation, and
                    stated that, while its revenue does not exceed t20,000 its expenditure
                    has increased to the enormous sum of t130,000 a year ! At present its
                    affairs are managed by commissioners, the responsible Ministers
                    of the Crown having no direct control over its expenditure. This
                    is manifestly an evil, and must form the subject of future
                    legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to provide for the
                    payment of certain bills now over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell
                        proposed that her Majesty should be authorized to
                    guarantee a loan of t210,000 for this purpose. Lord Stanley concurred
                    generally in the views of the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though
                    that the Government ought not to demand a loan until they had brought
                    in a bill to explain distinctly the principles on which they proposed
                    that the colony should henceforth be governed. Sir Robert Peel
                    suggested that the Government should ask a vote of credit for
                    the sum required, which, as it met the urgency of the case,
                    was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was deferred till Friday.

      <header>New South WalesMr Grote...</header>
      <text>
         <p>New South Wales</p>
         <p>Mr Grote rose to move a series of resolutions in condemnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emigration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of gaols and police in
                    that colony. It was in 1831 that this expense, antecedently
                    borne by the Home Government, was for the first time thrown upon the
                    colony, whose revenues were then found to yield considerable surplus of
                    revenue beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was
                    calculated to be about t25,000 a year ; and had that been all the
                    colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in fact it had ever since
                    averaged nearly t60,000. It was not reasonable to impose such a charge on
                    the colony, on account of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary
                    uses of a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our transportation system. The argument urged by the Home Government was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive
                    distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, whose
                    settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so assigned. But that
                    assignment was a gain, not more to the colonists, who obtained the labour,
                    than to the mother country, which saved the expense of maintaing the
                    labourers. Whatever value the mother country might be entitled
                    to claim for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not
                    on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and if there
                    were valid reasons against an exaction of premium from them, still it was
                    unjust to throw the obligation upon the colony at large. That was to pay
                    private wages out of public rates. This one charge on the oclony was
                    sufficient on account for all that embarassment in its finances which
                    had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled to defray
                    the impact, only by resorting to the emigration fund, and thus
                    checking emigration itself. No less than t260,000 had been abstracted from
                    that fund to meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that
                    fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, where
                    labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this country, to whom
                    that refuge is so material. He considered the emigration fund as held by
                    the Government in trust for the united intersts of the colony and of the
                    mother country. The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been
                    [?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed[?] would be applied to emigration.</p>
         <p>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of various persons in
                    favour of this strict application, when a motion was made to
                    count the House, and it adjourned for want of its quorum[?] of 40 members.

      <header>Emigration To New South...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Emigration To New South Wales.</p>
         <p>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolutions passed, on the
                    23d of October 1840, by the Legislative Cuncil of New South Wales, on the
                    subject of immigration into colony. The object of these resolutions is
                    to encourage emigration from the mother country, by showing the
                    demand for labour in New South Wales, and the advantages offered to
                    the immigrant. We have only room for a few of the more important resolutions :</p>
         <p>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony an urgent and increasing
                    want of working hands, in every branch of industry ; that there is ample
                        employment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages
                    without the interruption, in this mild climate, experienced
                    in colder countries during the winter months ; and that, even during the
                    worst period of the past severe drought, no persons able and willing to
                    work found any difficult in procuring advantageous employment.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there can be no more
                    advantageous field for the employment of industry than is presented in New
                    South Wales– experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, industrious and careful emigrants may, within a few years after
                    their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers to be themselves
                    employers of labour; by which process, and by the progressive
                    increase of the flocks and herds of the colony, a constant demand for
                    additional labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehension of a dearth of employment for as many as may
                    arise.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That this Council would particulary instance the large
                    and increasing sums at the credit of the working classes in the Savings
                    Bank of New South Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their prosperous condition, the deposits having increased from
                    t24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to t127,000 on 31st August
                    1840.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That great additiona advantage must accrue to the mother country
                    from the large consumption in this colony of British produce and
                        manufactures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to
                    1839, according to the official returns for that period, amounted to
                    more than eight millions sterling, having progressively increased from
                    t280,000, the amount in 1826, to t1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports
                    from the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, increased from t106,600 in the former year, to t948,776 in the
                    latter–the total amount being t6,187,530 for the whole period.</p>
         <p>Resolved. That the trade between the mother country and this
                    colony, together with the whale fisheries in the adjourning seas, also
                    affords a valuable nursery for seamen, important in this respect, in
                    proportion to the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to
                    strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that this field for the
                    employment of British shipping must increase with the growing prosperity of
                    the colony– considerations which appear to this Council to constitute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony,
                    to the fostering care of the British Government.</p>

      <text>
         <p>Emigration to New Zealand.–On Friday the
                    Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the river on her voyage
                    to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she
                    takes out 50 mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the
                    Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of other passengers,
                    amongst whom are Mr Swainson, Chief Justice, and Mr Martin,
                    Attorney-General, of the new colony, to which sations they have been recently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort of the
                    emigrants on board were certainly very complete ; and it must be
                    gratifying to know that those persons sent out by the company will be
                    provided with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a great
                    quantity of patent preserved provisions being shipped for that purpose on
                    board the Tyne. There are a greater number of children than usual in the
                    Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of from eight
                    to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, which now lies in the London
                    Dock, will clear out on the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty
                    well clear the depot of its present inmates.</p>

         <p>New Zealand Company</p>
         <p>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Friday, off the
                    West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, by the preparation for departure of
                    three fine vessels with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of
                    New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and several hundred persons
                    of rank and wealth met there to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants,
                    who appeared highly delighted with the honour extended to
                    them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the successful
                    result of their mission. After viewing the arrangeents made for the comfort
                    of all on board, the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern,
                    where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large room. The Duke
                    of Sussex took the chair, and was supported on the right by the Earl of
                    Devon, and on the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Company. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inverness, the
                    Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cottenham, Sandon, Marcus
                    Hill, Clements, Viscount Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon.
                    Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., Gowen, G. F. Young,
                    W. C. Young, and the Misses Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss
                    Petre, Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Robert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, Mrs, and Miss
                    Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Majesty's Emigration Agent;
                    MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wakefield, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S.
                    C. Brees, Captain Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which
                    the grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has made, was more
                    than once alluded to by his Royal Highness and other distinguished speakers
                    on both sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt upon
                    with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentlemen of the first
                    families go out with this expedition, which will be closely followed by
                    several first-rate ships.</p>

         <p>Colonial Land and Emigration Office, 9 Park street, Westminster,
                    Oct. 1, 1841.–In reference to the notice published in the Royal Gazette of the 6th of August last, to the
                    effect that all emigrants in respect of whom bounty was to be claimed in
                    New South Wales, must have left this country by the 1st of November
                    next, the Commissioners of Land and Emigration do hereby give further notice, in pursuance of directions from her Majesty's
                    Secretary of State for the Colonies, that in order to prevent the
                    consequences which must ensue if vessels should continue to be engaged
                    until too late to be dispatched by the required date, no ships can be
                    permitted to sail with a claim to bounty from the Colonial Government
                    beyond those which shall be forthwith returned to the Commissioners of
                    Colonial Lands and Emigration, and proved to be already under engagement
                    for the purpose.–By order of the Board, John Gliddon, Assis.-Sec.</p>

         <p>Wellington, New Zealand, June 18.–(From a private letter.)–"Among the latest
                        arrivals is Mr Swainson, F.R.S., the eminent naturalist, by the Jane, from London. He has purchased a house, and intends to reside here with his family. The Governor,
                    Captain Hobson, is daily expected from Auckland on a visit to Colonel Wakefield, the company's agent. Several emigrant ships
                    have lately reached us. The Katherine Stewart, Forbes, from
                    London, has just entered the harbour."</p>

      <text>
         <p>Emigration.</p>
         <p>A Return, just published, shows that emigration is still
                    proceeding upon a gigantic scale:–</p>
         <p>Emigrants from the United Kingdom in 1840.England. Scotland. Ireland. Total. To North American colonies,
                    5,303 3,053 23,935 32,293 United States, 35,309 1,246 4,087 40,0 Other
                    parts of America, 44 – – 44 West Indies, 745
                    687 159 1,591 The Cape, 315 8 – 323 Australia and New
                    Zealand, 14,495 817 538 15,850 56,213 5,811 28,719 90,743</p>
         <p>We have not the previous Returns at hand, but we believe that a larger
                    number of emigrants never left the shores of the British Isles in one
                    year than the above. It is startling to think, that 1800 persons quit
                    the kingom every week never to return. The natural increase of the
                    people must be about 1100 per day, of whom emigration
                    carries off 250, leaving 850 to swell the Census.</p>
         <p>The emigration to our North American colonies was as
                    follows:–</p>
         <p>To Canada, 21,209 –New Brunswick, 8,056 – Newfoundland,
                    387 –Nova Scotia, 972 –Cape Breton, 437 Prince
                    Edward's Island, 1,214 Hudson's Bay, 18 32,293</p>
         <p>To Australia it was:– Swan River, 224 South Australia, 2,748
                    Port Philip, 3,473 Sydney, 7, Van Diemen's Land, 299 14,392

      <header>Theatre Royal –The Pantomine, we...</header>
      <text>
         <p>Theatre Royal.–The Pantomine, we observe, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the theatre is
                    crowded nightly, the public being admitted at second price from
                    the commencement of the performances.</p>
         <p>Music Hall.–We stated, about two month ago,
                    that, in connection with other improvements in the Assembly Rooms, a plan
                    was under consideration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now
                    happy to announce, that at a meeting of the proprietors of
                    the Rooms last week, full pwers were given to the Directors to take the
                    requisite steps for carrying the design into execution. The desire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, will
                    soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid hall, constructed with a due
                    regard to the accommodation both of professional men and the
                    public, and with a minute attention to the most recent improvements,
                    by which full effect is secured to musical performances when conducted on a
                    grand scale. By what may be called a propitious coincidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, arrived in Edinburgh on
                    the very day when this resolution was come to.</p>
         <p>Martin's Paintings.–The exhibition of these
                    celebrated paintings in this city has already, we believe, attracted many
                    visitors. They are truly wonderful creations, and possess a power and
                    grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar to the public, convey but a
                    faint conception. In contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so
                    [?] [?] [?] the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details;
                    but these will be found on inspection to be among the most interesting
                    features of the picture. The groups of perishing beings are exquisitely
                    wrought, while everything is made to contribute to the terrific
                    grandeur of the catastrophe. The other two pictures–"Pandemonium"
                    and "the Rivers of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indicative of the high poetic genius of the artist. Nothing could be more striking than the contrast these pictures present to
                    each other–the one fearful beyond expression, the other
                    exhibiting a heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the eye rests
                    with delight. There are several other valuable paintings in this
                    collection, amongst which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a Rembrandt in fine preservation.</p>
         <p>Gordon's British Diorama.–This beautiful
                    exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we understand, been
                    crowded with visitors ever since. It will be seen by Mr Gordon's
                    advertisement in to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of London
                    during the recent conflagration (to which we alluded in our last) has now
                    arrived, and is being exhibited along with the other views.</p>
         <p>Broughton-place Congregation.–We understand
                    that the call given by Broughton Place Congregation to the Rev.
                    Mr Croon, Sanquhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown,
                    has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims which the
                    affectionate people among whom he presently labours have to continuance of
                    his services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a charge so
                    laborious; a result which, we learn, has caused among the members of
                    Broughton-Place extreme and general regret.</p>
         <p>Cooke's Equestrian Amphitheatre,Leith.–Mr Cooke has generously handed over
                    to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute Sick Society, the
                    handsome sum of t15; being the free proceeds of Friday evening's
                        entertainment, which took place under the patronage of
                    the Provost and Magistrates.</p>
         <p>Captain Ross' Discoveries.–Extracts from
                    Captain Ross' despatches have been published in a Parliamentary paper.
                    From the map which accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct idea
                    of his track than the previous article copied from the Athenean[?] afforded. South Victoria Land, which he discovered,
                    extends in latitude from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is unknown; and in longitude its eastern coast lies between 163
                    and 171. Its position is directly south from New Zealand, and at the
                    distance of 1500 geographical miles. The length of the part seen was
                    fully 500 miles. It was girt with a border of ice many miles in
                    breadth, which rendered it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed
                    at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, which was traced for
                    300 miles east from Victoria Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers
                    after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice at 66. The land " rose
                    in lofy peaks from 9000 to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with
                    eternal snow; the glaciers descended from near
                    the mountain summits, project many milesinto the ocean, and presented a perpendicular face
                    of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the mainland, but
                    landed on an island, which they found to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th
                    January, in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered a
                    magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame in a splendid profusion," and
                    named it Mount Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after the
                    other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance of less than half a mile from
                    the ice cliffs which barred their progress southward, they had soundings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, reached the bottom,
                    and, including the 150 feet above water, must have had an
                        elevation fo 2000 feetof thereabout. The observations on the dip and declination induced
                    them to place the South Magnetic Pole in latitude 76, and east
                    longitude 153; and they considered its position as well ascertained as if they had reached it, though their nearest approach to it
                    was a point 160 miles from it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole
                    is probably within that region, though this cannot be
                    positively affirmed, as its western boundary is unknown. The
                    highest latitude they reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12
                    degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer to it than Captain
                    Weddel[?], the most successful of their predecessors. The Non-intrusion Disclosures.–In the
                        Advertiser of yesterday there is a letter from
                    J. M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from the Rev. Dr Simpson of
                    Kirknewton, both expressing their extreme surprise at the letter
                    of Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and strongly disclaiming
                    all connexion with it on the part of the General Assembly's Committee.</p>
         <p>Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case.–We understand that the Government of Prussia,
                    thinking that the mode of keeping the Sabbath in that country
                    was in some respects too lax, recently sent over a person to this country,
                    to learn whether our practise in Britain would not furnish hints for
                    improvement. Unluckily, the very first specimens of our piety which met him
                    were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man Key who was
                    excommunicated for burying his child on Sunday. These will of course figure
                    in the very front of the officer's report as the natural
                    fruits of our system, and we may guess what their effect will be in
                    reconciling the Germans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We
                    can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that the fame of their
                    exploits has already travelled, by the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to
                    the uttermost parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement
                    of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and the shepherds of the
                    Riesengeberge. Key's case is no doubt destined to enjoy equal
                    celebrity.</p>
         <p>Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference.–
                    On Monday last, the members of the United Secession Church, Airdrie,
                    favourable to a repeal of the Corn and Provision Laws, met, in compliance with the request of the Committee taking the active
                    management of the Conference to be held in Edinburgh on the second week in
                        January next on that subject, when they unanimously appointed their pastor, the Rev. Matthew M'Gavin, A.M.,
                    Mr John Craig Waddell, proprietor, and Mr James Forrester,
                    merchant in Airdrie, to represent their sentiments at that meeting,
                    which is looked forward to with great interest by the liberal portion of
                    the inhabitants of the burgh. The Rev. Mr Taylor, with Messrs Adam
                    Nimmo, contractor, and John Young, bookseller, will represent the
                    Independent congregation; and Mr Thomas Muir, pastor of the
                    Baptist church, will represent that body on that occasion.</p>
         <p>Kirkcudbright–Address to the Deanof Faculty,–We learn that at a meeting,
                    held on the 17th current, of the Clerks and Procurators of
                    the Steward and COmmissary Courts, an address was voted to Alexander Wood,
                    Esq. on his appointment to the office of Dean of Faculty, and his
                    retirement from that of Steward of Kirkcudbright.</p>
         <p>Distress in Paisley.–We understand that the
                    Bookbinders of Edinburgh purpose to give a Grand Musical Melange in a few
                    days, the proceeds of which are to be handed over to the committee for
                    the distressed weavers in Paisley.</p>
         <p>Musselburgh.–Mr Wilson, Treasurer to the
                    "Honest Town," has, by the hands of the district committeesm collected
                    from the contributors to the Prince of Wales fund, nearly t100; and the
                    committees have already distributed 130 tons of coals to the
                    necessitous families in the neighbourhood.</p>
         <p>Presbytery of Dalkeith–Case of MrMonroe.–This Presbytery met on Tuesday the
                    21st current. At a former meeting an agent appeared for Mr
                    Monroe, presentee to Fala, and laid on the table of Presbytery a
                    presentation in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having been
                    objected that the presentation, and some other papers relative thereton,
                    bore, that Mr Monroe was presented merely to the parish of Fala,
                    and not to the united parishes of Fala and Soutra, the agent made his
                    appearance again at the meeting, which was held on Tuesday, with
                    a supplementary presentation, and also a letter acceptance from Mr Monroe. The agent, when asked, admitted that
                    he had not with him a Presbyterial certificate; and he stated, that he
                    would not ask the Presbytery to sustain the presentation with relative
                    papers at that meeting. But he intimated, that he intended to appear at the
                    next meeting, which is appointed to be held on the 22d of February,
                    and he expected to be able to show that the Presbytery should then sustain
                    the presentation and relative documents.</p>
         <p>Splendid Meteor.–On Tuesday evening, about
                    eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and splendour was witnessed in this
                    quarter. The evening was very clear, the sky being without a cloud,
                    and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, a dazzling blaze of light burst
                    from the sky, illuminating Benlomond and the distant hills, the
                    Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth and air on every side
                    as far as the eye could reach, with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The
                        phenomenon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong
                    shape, and apparently almost twice the size of the moon, having at the
                    time somewhat of the same silvery appearance as that luminary, but
                    flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to dazzle the eyes. A
                    tail of fire somewhat resembling that of a rocket, but composed
                    of the most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind it for a short
                    distance, adding much to its spendour, and giving the whole an
                    appearance at once singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it
                    disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appearance, and then
                    burst for an instant enveloping the earth and sky in a blaze as
                    bright and dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared to pass
                    from the south to the north, inclining towards the earth. To the
                    eye it seemed to burst and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another meteor of the same kind, but much less in size, brilliancy,
                    and splendour, was observed falling in a quartr rather farther to the
                    south, a few minutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of
                    notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with that first described in
                    the above, was seen at the same hour in Glasgow.–Stirly Journal.</p>
         <p>Glasgow.–The collection made on Sabbath
                    afternoon last, by the Rev. Mr Macfarlane's congregation,
                    Nicholson Street, Glasgow, amounted to t46, 7s. 6d. This sum is the more
                    praiseworthy when it is considered that this congregation has within a
                    few months subscribed among themselves nearly t1000 for the erection of
                    their beautiful place of worship to be called "Erskine Church," of
                    which they are erelong to take possession.</p>
         <p>The Unemployed in Paisley.–The number of
                    unemployed in Paisley has last week decreased by 43. In Kilbarchan and
                    Barrhead they were still on the increase. The following is the official
                        report of yesterday for Paisley and Barrhead :–</p>
         <p>Paisley.Males, 1865 Dependants, 4662 –6527 Females, 1680
                    Dependants, 3360 –5040 Total, 11,567 Barrhead.December 17, 287 ... 23, 346 Increase, 59 –Paisley Advertiser.</p>
         <p>The Paisley Manufacturing Committee.–This Committee continue to carry on their operations with
                    energy and zeal. The amount of the fund now exceeds t8000, and is still on
                    the increase. They have given out about 700 webs already, and are as
                    busy as possible preparing more. Unable to get a sufficiency of
                    webs warped in Paisley, they have sent for assistance in this respect
                    both to Glasgow and Johnstone. A good deal of work has this week been given
                    to warpers, winders and heddle-casters. They have taken much more
                    spacious premises in Gilmour Street, in order that they may the more easily
                    supply both town and country weavers. It is desirable that the
                    implement fund should be somewhat enlarged, as the other funds of the
                    Committee are not trenched on for that purpose –Ibid.</p>
         <p>Ducal Generosity.–After the late county
                    meeting at Hamilton, at which addresses were voted to the Queen and
                    Prince Albert, his Grace the Duke of Hamilton and several of those who
                    had attended the meeting visited the jail. One respectable looking
                    female attracted his Grace's attention; and on inquiry he was told that she
                    was the widow of a respectable wood merchant, now deceased, and had
                    been confined for upwards of a year, at the instance of a law agent in
                    Edinburgh, for costs incurred in a suit in the Court of Session. His
                    Grace immediately caused the truth of the poor woman's story to be
                    investigated, and on being satisfied of the facts he caused the debt to
                    be paid by his factor, and procured the woman's liberation, who has
                    thus through his Grace's generosity been restored to liberty and to the
                    superintendence of her young family.–Reformers'Gazette.</p>
         <p>Presentation.–A number of the members of
                    the United Secession Church, Airdrie, met in their vestry on the evening of
                    Wednesday the 22d inst. when Councillor Brown, in name of the
                    congregation, presented the Rev. M. M'Gavin, A.M., their pastor, with
                    a handsome pulpit gown and cassock, as a mark of their respect and
                    esteem; after which a number of the influential members of the
                    congregation entertained him to supper supper in Mr Witherspoon's King's
                    Arms Inn– Mr Daniel Gray, collector, Coltness Railway, in the
                    chair, and Dr Clarkson, croupier–when the evening was spent in the
                    most friendly, happy, and intellectual manner.</p>
         <p>A Rescue.–Last week, while the Duke of
                    Hamilton was riding along the wood leading from Hamilton to Bothwell,
                    he heard the screams of a female, and on looking towards the place whence
                    the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman belabouring a
                    woman in a most unmerciful style. No sooner did he observe this, than he
                    rode up to the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, knocked
                    the savage down, rescued the woman, and sent her home rejoicing, with more
                    money in her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess for a
                    long time. When we recollect that his Grace was born so long ago as October
                    1767, and so is in his 75th year, we cannot sufficiently admire his gallantry, humanity, and intrepidity– Glasgow Chronicle.Town Council.–The usual meeting of Council did not take place yesterday in consequence of the
                    Christmas holidays.</p>
         <p>House of Industry.–We understand that Miss
                    Grace Bailie had left a legacy to the Edinburgh House of
                    Industry of ten pounds sterling.</p>
         <p>Old Church.–The Lords of her Majesty's
                    Treasury have officially intimated to the parties interested their
                    intention to adhere to the original arrangement made with the Town Council,
                    for altering the Assembly Aisle, and rendering it fit to be
                    permanently used as a place of worship for the accomodation of one of the
                    city congregations.</p>
         <p>Prince of Wales Fund.–In the table of sums
                    subscribed in the different Wards of Police, published in our paper of
                    Saturday last, that indicated for the 26th Ward was t120, 12s.
                    9d. Mr Lindores, the General Commissioner, requests us to state, that
                    the sum subscribed in his Ward was t275, 12s. 9d., and that the difference
                    between the two sums is the amount of the very handsome subscriptions
                    by the Banks in St Andrew Square, and which were drawn by the
                    Treasurer.</p>
         <p>Presentation of Plate.–On Friday afternoon, about fifty citizens entertained Mr William
                    Donaldson, of the Albion Cloth Company, to an elegant dinner and
                    dessert, in the Turf Hotel, Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting
                    him with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for by the members
                    of the Celtic Lodge, and other private friends. Mr William Wright, hat
                        manufacturer, was in the chair, supported on the right
                    and left by the guest of the evening, Mr Pritchard of the
                    Theatre-Royal, and other gentlemen. Mr Dick of the Albion officiated as
                    croupier. After the usual loyal and preliminary toasts had been given,
                    the chairman called for a bona fide bumper for the
                    toast of the evening, and, after passing a handomse eulogium on those
                    various qualities of their guest which had endeared him to
                    all his friends, neighbours, and acquaintances, far and wide,
                    presented to Mr Donaldson, in the name of the subscribers, a very elegant
                    and massive silver tea set, of the value of t50. Mr Donaldon's health
                    was then proposed and drunk with warm and friendly enthusiasm. The presentee replied to the compliment in modest and appropriate
                    terms. The company spent an exceedingly happy and convivial
                    night; the chairman and croupier taking care that there should
                    be no flagging in the jovialty. The toasts were suitable to the
                    occasion. Mr Mackenzie's instrumental band played appropriate
                    airs to the various toasts and sentiments; and vocal music,
                    from amateurs, was never wanting; the guest himself being a host in
                    that department. The following inscription is neatly engraved on the
                    various pieces of playe :–"To Mr William Donaldson,
                    R.W.M. of the Lodge Celtic of Edinburgh and Leith, from a number of Masonic
                    and other Friends.–24th Dec. 1841."</p>
         <p>Theft and Recovery of a Pony.–At a late
                    hour on Sunday night a gentleman residing in the southern part of the
                    town dismounted from his pony at his own gate, and proceeding inwards,
                    leaving the animal to follow, as he was wont to do, to the stable. On
                    looking about, he observed a young man, whom he supposed to be his son,
                    take the reins and mount the pony. Shortly afterwards the son came
                    into the house, and the question of "Where is the pony?" soon convinced
                    the parties that it was stolen. They immediately proceeded in search,
                    and while the gentleman was giving information at the Police-Office, his
                    son discovered the pony with a rider on the North Bridge. He
                    immediately seized the reins and made a clutch at the thief; but the latter
                    very adroitly threw himself off at the opposite side, ran down the
                    Fleshmarket stairs, and escaped.</p>
         <p>Providential Recovery.–One day last week, a
                    fine little child, about five years of age, belonging to one of the
                    villagers at Ratho, having dandered[?] away with another little
                    play-fellow, like himself, to a little distance from the house, fell
                    into a deep well. His companion was found standing weeping at the edge. The
                    apparently dead body of the little one being got out, was taken home,
                    and all hopes of its recovery given up, when Dr Pringle, and excellent
                    young gentleman, who is presently assistant of Dr Craig at
                    Ratho, made his appearance, and, by applying himself with
                    indefatiguable perseverance, succeeded in recalling the
                    apparently extinguished spark. The next the little romp was as lively as
                    ever.</p>
         <p>Mungo Park.–A public meeting was held in
                    the town hall of Selkirk, on Monday the 26th current, the Chief
                    Magistrate in the chair; when various resolutions were adopted with the
                    view of erecting a monument or other permanent mark of respect for the
                    memory of this celebrated traveller.</p>
         <p>Thimble-Riggers.–A band of thimble-riggers from Edinburgh have for several weeks past been
                    infesting the roads in the neighbourhood of Glasgow. They are six in number
                    and one of them, an old man of rather respectable appearance, is generally in advance of the party, and having got into
                    conversation with a passenger on the road, and the others running up, and
                    desiring the old man to try his luck; he does so, and winning a trifle, he easily persuades the person with whom he has been
                    ingratiating himself to try also, and he is soon robbed of his whole spare
                    cash. Information having, on Wednesday last, been given to the
                    Procurator-Fiscal at Pollokshaws, and the gang were on the new
                        Kilmarnock Road, he immediately despatched two rural
                    police officers in pursuit of them. On the officers coming up to the
                    gang, they separated and ran off, but the officers captured two of them
                    (the old man and another), who were safely lodged in Pollokshaws Jail;
                    and having been brought before two of the Justices, and several
                    person having sworn to being defrauded by them of their
                    money, they were sentenced tothirty days' imprisonment in
                    Paisley House of Correction, with hard labour, as rogues and vagabonds; and
                    an active look-out is made by the police for the remainder
                    of the gang.</p>
         <p>Stoppage of Payments by the Town ofPaisley.–Partly on account of the great
                        depression of trade, and partly on account of a run raised
                    by the circulation of malicious and false statements
                    regarding the affairs of the community of Paisley, theTown Council, at a
                    meeting on Wednesday evening, ordered the Chamberlain to susspend receipt or payment of deposits, in the meantime, but to proceed with all possible despatch in realizing the
                    outstanding debts due to the community for the regular payment
                    of the interest on the money borrowed, and other current engagements of the burgh. It is pretty generally known that a
                    small portion of the would-be-political leaders of the town who
                    have not the influence to get themselves placed in municipal
                    authority, have for a good number of years endeavoured to
                    embarass the party in power, by attacking the credit of the
                    community. The unfavourabout state of trade and the leniency of
                    the Council in not enforcing during the last year the exactions on the owners of property, for entries, &amp;c.
                    falling due, caused a deficiency of nearly t300 in the usual amount of
                    revenue. This simple circumstance was taken advantage of, though
                    nothing was lost thereby, and statements prejudicial to the
                    town's credit were placed in the hands of every credito that could be found
                    by the individuals referred to, and thus uncalled for alarm
                    raised. In addition to this, the adherents of the same party in the
                    Council during the last five days gave currency to another statement which
                    they knew to be quite untrue, about the late Provost having
                    commenced to secure himself by drawing a thousand pounds, when the fact was
                    he had not drawn out a penny. From the position to which which the
                    affiars the town are now driven a full and public exposure of these matters
                    will soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council have been
                    negotiating for such a loan of money as will pay off those who are
                    dissatisfied, which in the ordinary state of the money market they
                    would long since have obtained, though at present that is difficult.
                    As regards risk to the creditors, from the best informed quarters we are
                    assured there is none. More than one-third of the whole debts of the
                    town are due to the Bank and the members of Council, or their immediate
                    friends, and fully a half of the debt against the river is due to the
                    same parties. This we should conceive the strongest proof that could be
                    adduced of the confidence of those who should best know the
                    state of the town's affairs.–Glasgow
                        Chronicle.</p>
         <p>Disgraceful Trick.–At a late wake in the
                    country, a short way from Crieff, a waggish fellow tied a
                    cord secretly to the neck of the corpse and while a number of young men and
                    women present were going on merrily with some sport the wag pulled the
                    cord, when corpse started up in the bed, making the clothes to fly off; the
                    whole party rushed to the door, crying for mercy upon them, and
                    knocking each other over in the hurry, when at length some people came to
                    their assistance, who afterwards discovered the cause of their
                        terror.–Perth Courier.</p>
         <p>The Church Question.–Long ago, Dr Chalmers let out the secret of the clerical movement, by
                    declaring that very little of Non-intrustion would satisfy him and his
                    friends, provided the independent power of the Church were secured.
                    Now, this liberum arbitrium does nothing at all
                    for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for Church Independence.
                    It confers no privilege on the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power
                    of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part of the claims that
                    have been advanced by the Church; and its effects would simply be to
                        sacrifice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand,
                    and clerical Moderates on the other. It means literally uncontrolled
                    power to the Church The General Steam Navigation Company's ship
                    Monarch, Captain Fraser, arrived at Granton from London on Monday
                    evening at half-past nine o'clock.</p>
         <p>Election of a Minister for Old Monk-land.–The election of a minster took place
                    at Old Monkland Church, on Thursday the 23d inst., and the right of
                    patronage being vested in the Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might
                    be considered a popular one. About 150 voters attended the
                    meeting, and a decided wish having been expressed by, it is understood, the
                    whole of the heritors that no candidate known to be connected with the Non-intrusion party in the Church should be chosen, the
                    meeting, acting upon this principle, unanimously agreed to elect the Rev.
                    Mr Johnston, Greenock, as minister of the parish. Considering the
                    number of voters, the unanimity that prevailed among the electors, it is
                    believed, is without precedent and stongly marks the sentiments and
                    feelings of a large and very populous parish on the present
                    proceedings of the dominant party in th Church. Mr Johnston was
                    proposed by General Pye Douglass of Rosehall, seconded by Mr M'Caul of
                    Daldowie, and unanimously elected.–Reformers' Gazette.</p>
         <p>Destructive Fire.–About three o'clock on
                    the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire was given at Balmangan
                    Mill, in the parish of Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr
                    Kissock, and despite the great exertions of himself,
                    servants and neighbours, the work of destruction proceeded with
                    a degree of rapidity that rendered it impossible to save a single article. The flames in their fury having charred the rafters,
                    the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, before long, the entire mill, with
                    the exception of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of ruins. The
                    building contained a considerable quantity of grain and oatmeal, the
                    property of the tacksman, all of which was unforunately destroyed. As the premises were found quite safe a very few hours
                    previously, suspicion of incendiarism have naturally arisen, but
                    no clue thus far has been found attaching guilt to a single individual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest malice,
                    and it is sad to think that any one could have been so wicked as to destroy
                    what thousands are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they only
                    knew how–daily bread–Dumfries Courier.</p>
         <p>Hamilton.–Some influential persons in Hamilton and the neighbourhood have subscribed to
                    build an Episcopal chapel in that town. We have been informed that all the
                    requisite arrangements have been made for carrying the views of the
                    subscribers into effect. This is one effect of the conduct of the
                    rebellious majority of the General Assembly. Many of thsoe now
                    friendly to the scheme, never dreamed of espousing Episcopacy, till they
                    have been driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, by the
                    conduct of their ministers; men who exist in their offices by law, and yet
                    set that very law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices,
                    and draw their "temporalities," as they cantingly term their good
                    things, which alone induce some of them, at least, to remain members of the
                        venerable Establishment. Who would have believed, some
                    years ago, that "Black Prelacy" was about to be established within sight of

         <p>Another New Field for Emigration</p>
         <p>The Falkland Islands have been nominally a British
                    colony for some years; but, in consequence of representations
                    made to Government by various persons interested in the trade to the South
                    Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for establishing a
                    body of settlers in these islands. It was submitted to the late Ministers,
                    who referred it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the Lords of
                    the Admiralty, by both of whom it was approved. Rules were prepared by the
                        Commissioners of Emigration ; a vote of t3750 was put
                    into the estimates for the first year's expense, and, we
                    suppose, passed. If steps have not been taken already to send out
                    emigrants, we presume they will be taken about the beginning of next
                    winter, which is their summer.</p>
         <p>These islands are about 300 miles from the south extremity of the American
                    continent, in a latitude corresponding with that of London. Their
                    climate, however, very closely resembles that of Shetland. They have cold
                    summers and mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but owing to their
                    humidity and want of sunshine, and the stormy winds which blow almost
                        constantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in
                    them, and even oats might turn out to be a precarious crop.
                    It is doubted also if wood will grow, and at present there is not a single
                    tree in the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, and there is
                    an abundance of good grass, upon which some thousands of black cattle,
                    horses, and hogs, thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been introduced and found to do well. Extensive peatbogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of fuel. The present
                    population consists of twenty five persons, young and
                    old–one-half of them British, the other Gauchos, South American
                        Indians of a semi-civilised description. They are all
                    stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural harbour, where a British
                    officer resides.</p>
         <p>The islands are numerous, but all very small except two, whose area is
                    estimated at 13,000 square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scotland. They are deeply perforated by arms of the sea, and
                    probably afford a greater number of fine natural harbours than any country
                    of equal extent in the world. Their shores afford excellent
                    fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly numerous.</p>
         <p>The great object in establishing a colony here is to provide a harbour of
                    refuge and place of refitment for our ships frequenting the
                    South Seas, which are yearly increasing in number. Every vessel going
                    to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from it, passes within sight of these
                    islands, or near them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass these
                    islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, and 20 more engaged in the
                    whale fishery. The trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, most
                    of which return to England by this route, which will also be preferred by
                    vessels trading to New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, and
                    probably South Australia. From Sydney or Hort Town the distance is nearly
                    the same by Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the prevalence of
                    westerly winds in the parallel beyond the 30th, renders the
                    latter route the more advantageous on the outward voyage, and the
                    former on the return. The Falkland Islands are about half as distant
                    from Britain as New South Wales.</p>
         <p>The Emigration Board recommend that Government should send out
                    two surveyors to select an eligible site for a town, and to lay out the
                    land in blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivided. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at 12s. per acre, and to
                    expend part of the money in carrying out additional settlers, part in
                    defraying the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in the
                    largest island, the privilege of shooting which, or catching and taming
                    them, might be sold to the settlers or a company. The climate is uninviting, but there is little doubt that persons accustomed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal hunting, or
                    deep-sea fishery, might drive a profitable trade here. A vast
                    number of ships, making long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well
                    as British, pass the islands, and to these it would be a great
                    accommodation to find supplies of provisions and the means of
                    refitting here. Some of our starving population in the North of Scotland
                    or the Islands, might better their circumstances by removing to the
                    Falkland Islands.</p>

      <text>
         <p>New Zealand.</p>
         <p>(From the Morning Chronicle.)</p>
         <p>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zealand Company to Lord
                    John Russell will serve to remove all apprehensions, if any are
                    yet entertained, with regard to the relations between that colony and
                    the Government of the parent state. Many of the first names in the
                    country honoured this splendid banquet by their presence ; and men of all
                    parties, Tories, Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only by
                    one common feeling.</p>
         <p>The public are now tolerably familiar with the natural advantages of New
                    Zealand, which appears destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great
                    Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with must felicity,
                    observed, " that the position of the New Zealand islands on the map, their
                    climate, fertility, abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most
                    suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the character to the
                    native population, led him to anticipate that these islands were
                    likely to become the great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John
                    Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for adding these
                    important islands to the great colonial empire of this country.</p>
         <p>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and deservedly applauded.</p>
         <p>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation of this colony of New
                    Zealand will tend to the honour and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to
                    the prosperity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It
                    was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent my humble
                    efforts in support of those exertions that had been made, and were about to
                    be made, by the New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I should
                    be unworthy of your approbation if I took any extraordinary merit to myself
                    ; for, in the first place, the principle of colonization, the value of
                    colonies to this country, the means they afford of augmenting her strength, of adding to her power, of promoting her
                    wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– all this has been
                    ascertained and demonstrated by the enlightened discussions of past years
                    (hear, hear). With regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we
                    have had the advantage and assistance of the most enlightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion I, therefore, can
                    only take to myself the merit of not being blind to the importance and
                    value of those opinions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</p>
         <p>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his own merits, in
                    recommending the adoption of these islands by the Crown, it was perfectly
                    well understood by all present that, for his conduct with respect to
                    his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the gratitude
                    of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him a deserved tribute when he
                    complimented him for the sagacity with which he had appreciated the
                        importance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on
                    the administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious measure
                    of setting up the British flag in them.</p>
         <p>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's Ministers, proposed by Mr
                    Hutt, M.P., was received with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr
                        Labouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was
                    well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to the City on this
                    occasion is calculated to gain the Government favour among the commercial
                    classes. His lordship may well be proud, that though New Zealand was
                    formally taken possession of in the name of the Sovereign of this country
                    many years ago, it was reserved for him to make it a British colony.</p>

      <header>There is something curious...</header>
      <text>
         <p>There is something curious in the preference which the emigrants from
                    England, Scotland, and Ireland display for different localities. The proportions emigrating the countries below are as
                    follows:–</p>
         <p>EmigrantsEnglish Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. To United States,
                    54, 14 1/2, 12 – Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 – Canada, 8 1/2,
                    25, 50 – Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7</p>
         <p>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of the persons who have emigrated," we can scarcely suppose that it includes
                    persons who went out to the countries mentioned on business, without any
                    intention of settling. In the report for Canada, the number who went
                    to the United States in 1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two thirds of what stands in the above table.</p>
         <p>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant to India or Ceylon appears
                    in the table; yet surely some persons go with the express view
                    of remaining in these countries.</p>
         <p>The number of person who were enabled to emigrate in 1841 by means of
                    bounties payable in the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, for
                    Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remembered that New South
                    Wales includes Port Philip.</p>
         <p>There are returns of land sold, but not in a very perfect form. In Canada,
                    in the year 1839, 1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres.
                    The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and 12s. to 13s. in
                    Upper Canada; the lands granted without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive
                    of those for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and
                    Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres have been sold at prices varying from 2s.
                    3d. to 3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable.</p>
         <p>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the three years, at prices from
                    2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.</p>
         <p>Lands sold in New South WalesAcres. Average Price. Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d.
                    1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d. 1841, 15,790, 20s. 0 1/2d.
                    Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d. 1840, 83,687, 51s. 11
                    3/4d. (Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. 531,930</p>
         <p>The sales were chiefly by auction.</p>
         <p>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, were about 130,000 acres, at
                    10s. or 11s.; in Western Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840,
                    1841, the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in South
                    Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales of land are no bad index of the
                    progress of the colonies in capital and cultivation; and, according to this criterion, it will be seen, that those which
                    were advancing most rapidly in the three years, were Sydney and
                    Port-Philip. The money received in payment of land in these two colonies
                    in 1839 and 1840, amounted to t307,647; and, if we understand the
                    report correctly, the whole of this sum is applicable to emigration, that
                    is, to defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants.</p>
         <p>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with them, or expended on their
                    passage, twenty pounds each; and thus the money which left the country
                    must have amounted to upwards of two millions.</p>
         <p>This gigantic emigration one of the things which convey an idea of the
                    immense resources of Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the
                    ninth part of the population of Europe; and we believe it may be
                    safely said, that all the other eight parts do not send out half the number
                    of emigrants annually which are sent by the British Isles alone.</p>

                    by Thomas Icely, Esq. who was a Director here, and who is on his way to
                    Sydney. Solicitor–James Norton, Esq.</p>
         <p>The Company was established and incorporated (and is now in full operation)
                    to carry out in Australia a principle which has been acted on
                    with great success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money in this
                    country, at a moderate rate of interest, on the credit of a large invested
                    capital, and laying it out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher
                    rate.</p>
         <p>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable notes, under the
                    Corporation seal, to persons desirous of advancing Money to the Company on
                    loan. The notes will be for t100 each, or any larger sum desired by
                    the lender, and will be made payable at any period which may be agreed
                    upon, not being shorter than two years. The notes will bear interest at the
                    rate of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on the 15th
                    January and 15th July), on the production of the half-yearly vouchers,
                    which will be annexed to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render
                    it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the note itself
                    until the principal becomes due. The form of note has been preferred to
                    that of bond, as admitting of transfer without expense or trouble,
                    whilst it affords equal security to the holder.</p>
         <p>The Colonial Board has been established in Sydney, and the
                    operation of the Company are at present confined to New South
                    Wales.</p>
         <p>Security being the first object of the Company, all the arrangements have
                    been framed with the view to attain that end.</p>
         <p>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per cent, although the current
                    rate is much higher. The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral security) must not be of less value than double the amount of
                    the loan. The non-payment of interest on the day it becomes
                    due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per cent, additional interest for the
                    period in arrear; and all parties in default for ten days
                    are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of the Company "without
                    further instructions" and "without distinction or exception of any
                    person whatever." The Colonial Board only draws on the Company,
                    as loans are agreed on; their bills must be advertised for
                    public competition and the purchasers pay the amount, in
                    exchange for the Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital of
                    which is t1,200,00) to the credit of the Company, to be drawn out by checks
                    of the Colonial Board in favour of the borrowers as the
                    mortgages are completed.</p>
         <p>The high character of the members of the Colonial Board, affords the fullest
                    assurance that these arrangements will be strictly adhered to in
                    spirit as well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced in
                    investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by the instructions of the
                    Court of Directors: indeed the Chairman of the Colonial Board states that
                    "he does not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment of all
                    the funds which may be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Board."</p>
         <p>The high rate of interest in Australia, has attracted much
                    private capital from this country to be invested in mortgages. These
                    investments have been made through the agency of individuals or mercantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies from
                    which the Company is exempt. To those who may desire to make such
                    investments, it must be obvois that the stock of the Company
                    presents a much superior security, and the prospect of a greatly increased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a large
                    profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, the money borrowed here at
                    half that rate.</p>
         <p>It is equally clear that those who merely seek temporary
                    employment for their money without becoming shareholders, cannot have a
                    better security than the Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due
                        payment of which, the whole capital of the Company, as
                    well as the mortgages on which the money is laid out, stand pledged. Every
                    shareholder is required to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he
                    becomes bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the Charter
                    supplies Creditors with the utmost facility in enforcing demands against
                    the Company. When it is considered that the funds of the Company here
                    are kept in Government Securities and no money lent in Australia, except on
                    the best mortgages on land, with collateral security in
                    addition, it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the
                    Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided preference over
                    mortgages in this country, which generally bear one per cent.
                    less interest than that paid by the Company.</p>
         <p>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed shall not exceed four times the
                    amount of capital paid up.</p>
         <p>That the whole capital of the Company, and all the mortgages on which their
                    money is lent, in Australia, shall constitute a security to the
                    lenders of money to the Company.</p>
         <p>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the power of taking collateral
                    security on stock, &amp;c.</p>
         <p>That every mortgage shall be registered–the register to
                    contain such particulars as the Governor of the colony may deem
                    necessary.</p>
         <p>That a copy of the register of the mortgages shall be kept at the office of
                    the Company, in London, for the information of the share-holders
                    and lenders.</p>
         <p>That an annual report be made to the Lords of the Treasury of all sums
                    borrowed by the Company, and of the appropriation of them.</p>
         <p>John Innes, Managing Director. No. 48 Moorgate

            <pb n="3"/>Kentucky, May, 19. 1790.</p>
         <p>We arrived safe at this place ???
                    beginning of April from Pittsburgh, and a dreadful passage we had of it. The waters of ??? river Ohio, which had risen rapidly
                    since March, now poured down in a perfect torrent; ??? we
                    were in as much danger of foundering at ??? rapids, as we would have been in the middle the Atlantic in a severe gale. We were
                        frequently too, in the most
                    imminent danger of our life from the
                    limbs of trees hanging just above the ???; and through which we were often hurried ??? rate of seven miles an hour, but
                    the impetuo??? of the stream. If
                    any of the canoes had been tangled among these branches (which in many
                        places hang very thick over
                    the river), they ??? inevitably have
                    been overturned, and ?????? buried in the ??? of the Ohio; fortunately ??? accident happened to us.</p>
         <p>Our apprehensions of drowning were equalled by those of an attack from the
                        Indians, who infest the river, and who inhabit ???
                    banks: Some time ago they killed a Mr. W??? Browne, and a Mr. Allison, who were returning to Lexington from Miami. The
                        barbarities they commit are
                    wanton and inhuman to the l???
                    degree. On the 3d ult. they attacked a boat ??? few miles from Limestone, and killed three ???sons, two men and a woman; a few
                    days after this they killed two
                    men on Licking river, and took a boy
                        prisoner, and on their return at ???ed a boat below the Scioto, as it
                    came to sh??? and killed four
                    men, and took one man and two
                    women prisoners. About three weeks ago they ???ed on a boat and a canoe, above the Scioto, ??? both sides of the river at the same
                    time, by which means they killed
                    two men; and in sho??? to such a
                    degree have they carried these inh??? practices, that it is dangerous to stir from home, but in large parties, and
                    properly prepar??? to receive them.

         <p>
            <pb n="5"/> Yesterday forenoon arrived at Spithead, the Lord Dorcester
                    merchantman, Edward Howe, master, bound from Halifax for London.</p>
         <p>In this ship came six Cherokee Chiefs, of the first rank, one of them born
                    in England.</p>
         <p>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, Sir Andrew Douglas,
                    Commander of the Alcide, of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore
                    to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to Bradley's, the crown
                    Inn.</p>
         <p>The object of these Chiefs coming to this country is, to
                    endeavour to form a connection with the English Government, in order to
                    attempt the reduction of Mexico, near which place they have
                    20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more in a short time.</p>
         <p>The Cherokees have menaced that country for these last three years, and are
                    favoured by great number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settlements; should they, therefore, procure respectable
                    assistance from England, the New World will be a certain conquest, and
                    open a source of trade and wealth to this nation, that will more than
                        compensate for the loss of America, and the expence of
                    attaining that grand object.</p>
         <p>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of their country, with their
                    faces painted in an extraordinary manner. They waited on Colonel
                    Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some other officers of
                    distinction. One of them, who was born in England, named Bowles, speaks
                        English indifferently well, and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his parents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by some means strayed to an
                    Indian camp, where he was most hospitably received, and afterwards raised to the highest honours of their nation.</p>
         <p>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day, to deliver their
                        ??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville.

         <p>
            <pb n="5"/>MONDAY, JAN. 7.By the Fanny, Capt. Bryen, arrived in twenty four days from New York,
                    we have American papers, of which we give the following important
                    intelligence:–</p>
         <p>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron
                    D'Carondolet, Governor of Louisiana, and Governor O'Neal, of Pensacola, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, in West-Florida, to
                    the Creeks and Cherokees, and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance, advising and stimulating them to go to war against
                    the frontier inhabitants of the United States, and that quickly, that now
                    or never was the time, while the United States were engaged with the
                    northern tribes.</p>
         <p>On the 30th of September, about midnight John Buchanan's station, four miles
                    south of Nashville,) at which sundry families had collected, and
                    fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees,
                    supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach
                    was suspected by the running of cattle, that had taken fright at them,
                    and upon examination, they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of
                    the gate, and from the place and distance they received the first fire
                    from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately
                        returned the fire, and continued a very heavy and
                    constant firing upon the station, blockhouses surrounded
                    with a stockade for an hour, and were repulsed with considerable
                    loss, without injuring man, woman, or child, in the station.</p>
         <p>During the whole time of the attack, the Indians were never more
                    distant than ten yards from the Block House, and often in large numbers
                    close round the lower walls, attempting to put fire to it. One
                    ascended the roof with a torch, where he was shot, and falling to the
                    ground, renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and
                    was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the
                        over???ing, which lodged in the
                    roof in the circumference of the bat, and those sticking in the walls on
                    the outside are innumerable.</p>
         <p>Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September,
                    as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Cherokee towns, and below, as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about
                    100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that
                        attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected, but it is now hoped, that the check they have
                    received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon
                    that settlement.</p>
         <p>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek, (a
                    branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command,
                    of Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by surprise,
                    about an hour and a half in the night, by a party of Indians, commanded by
                    a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the Bench, and
                    Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.</p>
         <p>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George Morse and Robert Sharp, at a
                    fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were killed, and 7 taken off.</p>
         <p>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor
                    O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add he
                    has well acted his part!!!</p>
         <p>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), that on Tuesday the 23d of
                    October last a fire broke out in that town, owing to the negligence of
                    a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores, and
                    28 buildings of other descriptions.</p>

            <pb n="3"/>Richmond, January 28.Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing atQuebec, to his Correspondent in this City, datedJan. 9, 1972</p>
         <p>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by
                    the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed
                    1000, and that nothing saved General St. Clair, and the remainder of
                    his army, but the great quantity of plunder he left to the
                    Indians; they were composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of of
                    them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to take scalps, the trophies
                    of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation,
                        acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a
                    purchase, and the riches they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions
                    they found, will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have
                    been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms, which
                    they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets,
                    and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on
                    foot, that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The
                    indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have
                    all entered into an association, and made the present war a common concern,
                    they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the
                    different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the
                    chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace, and offered his
                    mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States, and could
                    give them no assistance. Their answer was, that the enemy was in their
                    country, and would not make peace with them, but on term dishonourable,
                    and at the expense of their country, and that they had determined to
                    die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied
                    with the answer they received, and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.</p>
         <p>You may depend on it, that many years will elapse, and many
                    thousand men be expended before the United States will, by the present
                    measures, be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also
                    add, that I have great apprehensions, that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of
                    the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be
                        taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence
                    already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to
                    take the country from them by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and
                    ought to be abandoned; besides, if the American mean to have anytrade
                    with them, they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to
                    come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuries</p>
         <p>Carlisle, Jan. 4. 1792.</p>
         <p>By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday, we are informed, that
                    previous to his leaving Pittsburgh, an express had arrived there
                    with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin
                    were taken by Indians, and that two large bodies of them
                    were moving to the Allighany.</p>
         <p>Extract of a Letter from Patowmack, North Amerca, Feb. 7.</p>
         <p>"Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish, which he
                    left about two weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing
                    interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that two days before he
                    left Cat-fish, two men arrived there from Licking, who informed, that they
                    had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback
                    from Kentucky, under General Scott; that they left Licking on the
                    expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott
                    dispatched three spies in advance, who, when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they
                    discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with
                    the plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dancing,
                    &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being
                    given to General Scott, who, with the main body, were a few miles in the
                    rear, he divided them into three divisions, advanced, and
                    fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short, but victorious,
                    on the side of the volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the
                    spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken, and the
                    remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott, having
                    lost but six men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most of the
                    cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General
                    Scott had previously gone out with 400 men, but finding his
                        number was insufficient, was returning but met a body
                    of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he immediately
                    proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved
                    successful.</p>
         <p>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of
                    January, at Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedition, which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish, and
                    that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps."</p>

         <p>
            <pb n="2"/> The unsettled state of a great part of the Westtern
                    Frontiers of America (if we can suppose that there are any determined
                    frontiers when the settlers are making large and continual
                        encroachments) must very much depreciate the sale of lands
                    in those parts, notwithstanding the very small rates of purchase
                    demanded for vast extents of ground, and the soil being remarkable fertile
                    and productive. The ineffectual attempts of last summer to
                    prevent the future depredations of the Miamis, and some other
                    tribes of Indians, and the barbarities before and since committed on the
                        setlers, must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their
                    lives and property on a very precarious teure, unless the arms
                    of the State prove remarkably successful in their future
                    attacks.</p>

         <p>The red bugs, which did so much injury to the cotton last year, have again
                    made their appearance, but not in such numbers as was first
                        expected.</p>
         <p>The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.</p>
         <p>A letter from Great-Ogreechee, in Georgia, dated December 9th, says, "since
                    the completion of the treaty with the Creeks, all has been
                    very quiet, unless we except some ill-natured state- bickerings and
                    heart-burning amongst ourselves, chiefly occasioned by a few influential
                    men, who find themselves great losers by a general act of common
                    justice towards the Indians. These, however, we expect, will subside by
                    degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks, Siminoles, and other nations adjoining our Western frontier, nothing is
                    clearer than that, so far from being injurious to us, they may henceforward
                    be made useful to the real interests of this State, provided the faith of treaties be observed. They now show every disposition
                    to copy our manners, arts, agriculture, and mode of living.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/> Mr. Bowles, the Cherokee Chief, proposes to introduce the art of
                    Printing amongst the Indians, with whom he resides; and, for
                    this purpose, has engaged two persons to accompany him on his return,
                    and has provided himself with all the implements of the art. The day fixed
                    for their departure is the 20th of March</p>
         <p>The Indian companions of Mr. Bowles are two Creeks and two Cherokees. these
                    nations, though contiguous to each other, and in strict union, differ
                    as essentially as possible in language and manners. Both, however,

                    avowing they mean to try to diminish.</p>

      <header>The Indian Chiefs...</header>
      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="5"/> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They
                    have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees, but three of them
                    only are of that nation, and three are Creek Indians.–They are
                    all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty- five or twenty-six.
                    These six Chiefs have 20,000 warriors ready to take the field, and have the
                    strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They
                    travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax, and were near
                    12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in
                    an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, by whom they were
                    sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the
                    Ministry.</p>
         <p>The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They
                    long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them
                    was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he hoped in six months
                    from this time to be in the heart of Mexico.</p>

         <p>
            <pb n="2"/> When hostilities are once commenced, a forfidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the
                    Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt,
                    when we shall be aided by an army of 20,000 Indian warriors, beside
                    the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/> So determined are the Cherokees, the Creeks, and other nations
                    of Indians in the Southern parts of America, to strip the Spaniards of
                    their possessions on that Continent, that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement, even though the
                    policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual
                    assistance.</p>
         <p>The rich silver mines at Potosi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in
                    1545, by an Indian, as he was clambering up the mountain, in pursuit
                    of a Lama, which had strayed from his flock. Soon after, the mines, of
                    Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were
                    opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both
                    colonies, and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them,
                    and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm, and the
                    new Kingdom of Grenada, has become the capital occupation of the
                    Spaniards, and is reduced into the system no less complicated than
                    interesting.</p>

            <pb n="3"/>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum
                        to his Friend in the City of Norwich, (Connecticut,)
                        dated Nov. 24, 1790.</p>
         <p>"The prospect of peace from our frontiers, seems to me to be vanished for
                    the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned, and the best account I can collect of the
                    expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to
                    about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, after seventeen days march from
                    Miami, reached the great Miami village, about 170 miles, without any molestation, except having a number of their pack-horse
                    stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted, and all the
                        valuable builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring
                    villages, without molestation, and deftroyed five of them, and a
                    quantity of corn, computed at fifteen thousand bushels, which
                    they found buried in different places, and very large quantities of
                    vegetables of every kind. The firstopposition that was met with, a party of about 150 Kentucky militia,
                    and thirty regular troops, all under the command of Col. Hardin, of Kentucky, were detached from the main body, lying in the great
                    Miami village, to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day
                    before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles, they came
                    up with, and were attacked by surprise, by a body of Indians, who were
                        concealed in the thickets on every side of a large
                    plain; and on the first onset the militia, without exchanging a single
                    fire, made a most precipitate retreat, and left the regular troops to stand
                    the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody;
                    the troops were soon overpowered by numbers, and all fell,
                    except the two offiers and two or three privates, after
                    defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn, of Franklin, was one of the
                    four that escaped, and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly
                    circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, and by that means
                    screening himself from the eye of his pursuers, that from any other
                    circumstance. Captain Armstrong, who commanded the party, likewise
                    made his escape, by plunging himself into a pond or swamp, up to
                    his neck, within two hundred yards of the field of action, where he remained the whole night, as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance, performed over the dead and wounded bodies of
                    the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks,
                    mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, rendered his
                    situation shocking. After this, some few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing
                    material, until the second capital action, which happened two days
                    after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town,
                    the General ordered a halt, and detached from four to five
                    hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, commanded by Major
                    Wylls, all under the command of Col. Harden, with orders to
                    march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town, there
                    appeared a small body of Indians, who immediately fled at the first onset,
                    and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by making their
                    flight into different directions, and encouraging the militia to pursue; by
                    this means the regular troops were left alone, and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small
                    handful of regular troops detached from the main body of
                    militia, they commenced the attack with their whole force,
                        excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia
                    returning on their back, pursued their object of routing and destroying the
                    troops; as the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody conflict on
                    each side, they effect. The regular troops, all to nine, including two
                    commissioned officers, were killed and disabled, and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, of Hartford,
                    and Lieut. Frothingham, of Middletown. Of the militia, it is
                    said, about an hundred were killed, among whom were a number
                    of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, it appears, from some
                    cause, did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from
                    the field of action, for most of the troops that were not
                    killed, or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they never could
                    have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.</p>
         <p>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the
                    militia they appeared to despise, and with all the undautedness
                    conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed upon the bayonets of
                    the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far
                    superior in numbers soon overpowered them, for while the poor soldier
                    had his bayonet in one Indiaman, two more would sink their tomahawks in his
                    head. The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead and wounded were
                    left on the field in possession of the savages.</p>
         <p>"No damage, of any consequence, has been sustained in this part of the
                    country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may
                    have on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.– If the
                    Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace, we shall be safe; if
                    not, we are much exposed."</p>

            <pb n="3"/>New York, August 4.</p>
         <p>On Monday the 12th ult. there was a violent tempest at Leominster,
                    Massachusetts, attended with hail which was of such a size, and fell with
                    such velocity, that the stoutest Indian corn was beaten into
                    shreds–vast quantities of apples were beaten from the
                    trees–not only the fruit but the trees received great injury, the
                    bark being broken from their limbs; the windows broken in the
                    house, and the fences renewed such impressions, as to be discovered at
                    90 yards distance. Many of the hailstones were as large as hens
                    eggs–the common size was a little more than an inch in diameter. Twenty-give hours after it fell, banks of it were
                    measured at the foot of a hill, and found to be 20 inches deep.</p>
         <p>The Saturday following great damage was ??? by hail at Shrewsbury, country of Worcesster.</p>
         <p>August 15.On Sunday the 25th July, a violent hail storm commenced a few miles to
                    the westward of Wilmington, Delaware, which did great damage to
                    many fields of grain, and blew down, in many places, an immense
                    quantity of timber. The hail in this storm was of an extraordinary
                        appearance; part of it being about two inches long, and
                    of a very considerable circumference.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 1st inst. arrived at Wilmington, Delaware, the
                    brig Maria, Capt. fort, from Londonderry, with 200 passengers.</p>
         <p>On the 4th inst. arrived at Philadelphia, the Happy Return, Capt. Ewing, in
                    8 weeks from Londonderry, brought 340 passengers in good health: Capt.
                    Ewing parted, near the Capes of Delaware, with the ship Sally, Capt.
                    Miller, with passengers from Londonderry for that port also.</p>
         <p>Pennsylvania, July 21.Last Sunday evening Mr. John Garrison, son of William Garrison, of
                    Newbury township, in this county, was killed by lightning in his own
                    house. The lightning struck in at the gable and just at the instant
                    that Mr. Garrison was in the centre of the floor, walking towards the
                    window; his brother was standing within two yards of him when he fell,
                    but providentially received not the smallest hurt.</p>
         <p>We also learn, that Patrick M'Sherry, of Little's-town, in this
                    county, had two cows killed by lightning, the same evening.</p>
         <p>New London, July 30.A slight shock of an earthquake was fel tin this and the neighhbouring
                    towns, on Sunday morning last, about thirty minutes past five o'clock.</p>
         <p>Middletown, July 25.About five o'clock this morning, a noise was heard that seemed to pass
                    over this city, which is thought to have come from a north-westerly
                        direction and proceeded to a south-easterly one. The
                    noise was equal to loud heavy thunder, and the commotion occasioned by
                    it very sensible in the shaking of houses, but no damage was done.–
                    The Tuesday preceding, about six or seven miles to the southward of
                    this place, a similar but heavier noise was heard, attended with
                    the like commotion.</p>

                    we cannot tell, but the lightning has been peculiarly destructive in many

            <pb n="2"/>CONGRESS.Wednesday, Dec. 8.</p>
         <p>The SPEECH of George Washington, Esq;President of the Congress, on ??? the ???</p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, andHouse of Representatives,</p>
         <p>IN meeting you again, I feel much satisfaction on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable
                    prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The
                    abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty, and with the means of flourishing commerce. The
                    progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of
                    American stock abroad, as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for
                    this and other national purposes, have been productive
                    beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter
                    circumstance is the more pleasing, as it is not only a proof the fertility
                    of our resources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add, as it
                    bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of
                    the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the
                    former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.</p>
         <p>"In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session, a loan
                    of 3,000,,000 of florins, towards which some provisional measures had
                    previously taken place, has been completed in Holland.–As well the
                        exchange with which it has been
                    filled, as the nature of the terms (considering the more than
                    ordinary demand for borrowing, created by the situation of
                    Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those
                    powers, may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the
                    treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.</p>
         <p>"Since your last sessions, I have received communication, by
                    which it appears, that the district of Kentucke, at present a part of
                    Virginia, has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that
                    state, in consequence of which the district is to become a
                    distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of
                    Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall
                    cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you.
                    The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted, will be
                    found to do great honour to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its
                    present Government, expressed by our fellow-citizens of
                    Kentucke, cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare, to the great national impressions under
                    which you will declare on the case submitted to you.</p>
         <p>"It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been
                    made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from
                    the north west side of the Ohio. These, with some of the tribes dwelling on
                    and near the Wabash, have of late been particularly active in their
                    depredations; and, being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and
                    aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities, or afford them a retreat for their
                    prisoners, and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane
                        invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable
                    citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances
                    peculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried into a deplorable
                    captivity.</p>
         <p>"These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the
                    safety of the western settlements, that the aggressors should be made
                    sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of
                    punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to respect their rights
                    and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by
                    defensive measures, it became necessary to put in force the act which
                    empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the
                    frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition, in which
                    the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts
                    of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to
                    me, The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of
                    the information on which it is founded, as well as an estimate of the
                    expence with which it will be attended.</p>
         <p>The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical
                    posture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more
                        thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by
                    the United States, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection
                    with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that
                    we should not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations
                    for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with
                    this country, to abridge in means, and there by enhance the prince of
                    transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections, how far and in what
                    mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from
                    these contingencies, by such encouragements to ur own navigation as
                    will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms,
                    which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these
                    great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our
                    own produce, offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this
                    evil.</p>
         <p>"Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our
                    trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite
                    in rendering the present state of it destresful to us, that you
                    will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief
                    and protection.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>"The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a
                    judiciary system, have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of
                    persons. You will consider in your wisdom, whether improvement of a judicatory system, have opened the doors of justice to all
                    descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom, whether im provements in that system may yet be made, and
                    particularly whether ??? ???process
                    of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts,
                    be not desirable through all the States.</p>
         <p>"The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and seamen, has called for
                    the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems
                    expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and
                    those functions which are permitted them, either by express
                    convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence.
                    The Consular Convention too, with his most Christian Majesty, has
                    stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the National authority to his
                    Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.</p>
         <p>"The establishment of the Militia, of a Mint, of Standards of Weights and
                    Measures, of the Post Office and Post Roads, are subjects which (I
                    presume) you will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their
                    own importance.</p>
         <p>"Gentlemen of the House of Representatives, "The
                    sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects
                    to which they are appropriated, leaves no doubt that the
                    residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects
                    for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to
                    hope, that it will be a favourite policy with you, not merely to secure a
                    payment of the interest of the debt founded, but as far and as fast as
                    the growing resources of the country will permit, to exonerate it of the
                        principal itself. The appropriation you have made of
                    the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject, and I am
                    persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute, along
                    with other means, to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more
                    salutary will the measure be toe very public interest, as well as be more
                    satisfactory to our constituents.</p>
         <p>"Gentlemen of the Senate, and House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>"In perusing the various and weighty business of the present
                    session, I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be
                    equally marked with wisdom, and animated by the love of your country.
                    In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all the co-operation which
                    an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us
                    both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration of our
                    respective trusts, we can make the established government more and
                    more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more
                    and more the object of their attachment and confidence. (Signed) GEORGE WASHINGTON."United States, Dec. 8 1790.</p>

            <pb n="6"/> The following, it is said, are the authentic particulars of
                    General St Clair's expedition in America. The Miamis Indians had been for a
                    long time extremely troublesome to the Americans, and it
                    was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair
                    completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a
                    detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the
                    River St. Joseph, where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were
                    killed, but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, and 150
                    men were killed, and they were not able even to bring off their wounded.
                    This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage, and induce them again to make head against the American
                    army.</p>

                    Philadelphia is completed, and that the city is found to contain fifty
                    three thousand inhabitants.</p>
         <p>A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that
                    state, that a serious petition is now drawing up, to be presented to
                    the next congress, stating arguments in favour of polygamy, from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a
                    man may legally marry two wives. This, it is thought, will be the most
                    effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old

         <p>Oct. 13. The ship Betsy, Rook, arrived on the 6th
                    instant, at Wilmington, Delaware,, from Londonderry, in Ireland. This
                    vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants, some of them
                    people of property; who, weary of the patronage of their old
                    tutelar saint, St. Patrick, have come to settle themselves and their
                    posterity in America, under the more liberal auspices of St.

         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman, in the countyof Lincoln, Massachusets, dated Sept.
                        14.</p>
         <p>"We have had a very wet season here since you went from us, and the grass
                    hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens, and
                    all the grass; of course, as the natural consequences, we
                    have no milk, neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the
                    corn has also suffered very much from those insects"</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia)Sept. 20</p>
         <p>"A firm peace being now, to all appearance, secured between the United
                    States and the Creek Indians, we may reasonable expect that the state
                    of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate
                    beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place.
                    The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river
                    are rapidly rising in value, and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for
                    the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men, who
                    instead of being mere lookers on, in quality of overseers and drivers,
                    would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe, and
                    make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in
                    the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of
                    Altamahaw, is one of the most beautiful you can imagine,abounding with everything that can make life comfortable, besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of
                    Sapola, with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several
                    vessels are hourly looked for from France, (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and
                        ??? in the river of St. Mary's."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Hampton
                            (Virginia)Sept. 25."There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance
                    on different parts adjoining James river, the exportations of which, in the
                    opinion of rational men, ought to be considered as of the greatest
                    importance to this state. These articles are coals, and clays for the
                    several colours of paint, which may be had in any quantity, and may be
                    afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal, from every discovery
                    we have been able to make, are inexhaustible; all the samples, however,
                    that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface,
                    and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better
                    will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand,
                    there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the
                    United States with coal equally good with that from Europe, and at a
                    much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to
                    our paints, there are none better in the world, and in quantity, when
                    manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river, of
                    property and enterprize, are beginning to turn their attention
                    to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature, it is
                    thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their
                    attention."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Charleston,
                            Sept. 27.</p>
         <p>"On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard, Hubcaw, a fine new brig,
                        calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice, the property
                    of Mr. Hary Grant, and is to be called the Pringle. A
                    number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight,
                    with which they were no less delighted, than with the liberal entertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???."</p>
         <p>Boston, Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port,
                    the ship Columbia, Capt. Robert Gray, on a circum
                    navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the
                    second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much
                    praise cannot be given to the gentlemen, owners of the ship, for their
                    exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of ???has returned to the place of its nativity.</p>
         <p>Dr. FRANKLINNever declare yourself the author of a ???,without being, beyond doubt, certain of ???, was the Doctor's advice. He
                    generally enforced his percepts by giving an example.</p>
         <p>I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance
                    at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern
                    keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection
                    for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several
                    hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and he well pleased with
                    the success of his persuasion, went for his hat to collect what we were
                    willing to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it into small
                    pieces, which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern
                    keeper goes round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our paper in
                    his hat. The fiddler returns, and the landlord with a cheerful face and an
                    air of self approbation, boasts of what he had been doing for
                    him; "It was I persuaded them to make the
                    collection, I made them give, I went round to every one, and see what I
                    have got. If it had not been for me"–the fiddler examines his prize,
                    and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon
                    the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffered for proclaiming
                    himself the author of a project before its success was fully
                    ascertained.</p>

            <pb n="5"/> The Indians, on the borders of Kentucky, continue to commit the
                    most horrible acts of cruelty upon such unfortunate Americans as
                    fall in their power. The burning of the Miami villages, and the
                    destruction of their corn and vegetables, instead of intimidating those
                    ferocious savage, have made them more and more vindictive and
                    restless; and being acquainted with all the passes in the country,
                    they bid defiance to their pursuers, whom they frequently surprise and cut

                            Journal.Winchester, Oct. 20.</p>
         <p>By recent intelligence from Kentucky we learn that a short time ago an
                    American vessel was seized at New Orleans, and her cargo
                    disposed of by the Spaniards. Also, that the troop which went out
                    against the Indians had, not far from the banks of the Ohio, fallen in with
                    about forty of them, whom they made their prisoners, after a slight resistance; and that having washed them, 15
                    turned out to be white men.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Nov 9.</p>
         <p>We hear from undoubted authority, that a considerable loan has
                    been negotiated in Holland for the service of these United States.</p>
         <p>Albany, Nov. 4.</p>
         <p>The Legislature of Vermont have resolved to pay to the State of New York
                    30,000 dollars, agreeably to the first proposition contained in the
                    declaration of the Commissioners of this State, appointed
                    to declare the consent of the Legislature thereof, that a certain territory
                    within the jurisdiction of the State of New York be erected into
                    a new State on the 17th of October last; in consequnece
                    whereof, all rights and titles to lands within the State of Vermont, under
                    grants of the late colony of New York, or from the State of New York
                    (except such grants as were intended as confirmations of those from New
                    Hampshire) cease and determine. The Legislature have also resolved,
                    that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution
                    of the United States; the members to be elected in December, and the
                    Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature
                    have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January, for the
                    purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators, and affixing the time and
                    manner of electing Representatives for Congress.</p>

                    of the United States in their redemption of the public debt, is
                    dangerous to the rights, and subversive of the interest of the
                    people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly."</p>

         <p>The stone work of the light house, at the entrance of our
                    harbour, is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant, the last stone was
                    laid by Mr. Nichols, of this town, master builder. The work is
                    extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high. To
                    this the lanthorn, which is to be six feet in diameter, will add about
                    15 feet, 85 feet in whole. The lanthorn is now preparing, and will
                    probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month.</p>
         <p>Baltimore, Nov. 23.</p>
         <p>A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate
                    fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder, and
                    the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of
                    this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly
                    advantageous to this State and town, but may, if properly encouraged, become a national benefit.</p>
         <p>York (Pennsylvania), Nov 10.From Wright's Ferry we learn, that about four o'clock on Wednesday
                    afternoon, as a boat was coming from the East side, a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over, by which means she was soon filled with water, and sunk. there was
                    six passengers and the ??? in her
                    (besides a small light waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the owner of the waggon,
                    with his wife and three children; when the storm came on, the woman
                    and children took shelter in the waggon, but it continued to blow with
                    such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body
                    having by chance got loose from the carriage, and being pretty tight,
                    floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband, viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and
                    children, resolved to relieve or perish with them, and quitting the boat
                    swam to the waggon, cut open the cover with his knife, and with
                    difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat
                    from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted
                    his horse, one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by
                    this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the
                    other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan, depending on his skill in
                    swimming got up an oar, but it is thought he is drowned, as he has not
                    since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls, and one of the
                    waggon horses that had been given up for lost, was found next day some
                    distance below the falls, with all his geers on, and does not appear
                    to have received the least injury.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Sunbury, NorthumberlandCounty (Pennsylvania), dated Nov.
                        13.</p>
         <p>"One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek, was tried on
                    Saturday evening, and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the
                    hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed, and the confession of his
                    counsel at the bar that confirmed it, yet, notwithstanding an express
                    charge from the judges to bring him in guilty, the jury in a few
                    moments returned with a verdict in his favour, and a subscription to pay
                    the costs of the suit, that he might be immediately set at liberty;
                    and all this from a most absurd idea, which the Attorney General, with all
                    his endeavours, could not beat out of them, that the crime
                    was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets
                    the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify
                    the Indians now, Heaven knows, while at this moment the other
                    murderers are at large in this country, and no one will arrest them."</p>

         <p>
            <pb n="2"/>Halifax, April 6.</p>
         <p>The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The
                    bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down, and the Mill there is
                    much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away;
                    and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more
                    than 2000l. will repair.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>Since the retreat of the f–eral troops, under General Harmar, the
                    Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large
                    body of them, on the 2d of February, attacked the settlements called Big Bottom, twenty miles from Harman, on the Muilsingam,
                    which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were
                         massacred, two escaped and three were taken prisoners.</p>
         <p>Boston.</p>
         <p>The amount of the value of theexports from the United States, for thirteen
                    months, agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury,
                    in 20,000,000 dollars.</p>
         <p>The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage
                    neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state, that there has
                    been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our
                    frontiers early in the spring.</p>
         <p>Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country
                    of Marcetta, from their plantations into the city, where they do
                    military duty.</p>
         <p>According to the late Census, the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth
                    is 470,000.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, April 7.Congress met here to-day and made a house, Articles of the
                    Constitution, that were not liked by many of us, are altered much for the
                    better– among other things, we were dissatisfied that not any
                    notice was taken of Religion, as we wanted it expressly declared, that not
                    any sect should ever be established in preference to
                    another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know
                    not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free.</p>
         <p>It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of
                    people; we are yet about three, so that,for sometime we have have not any
                    great cause to fight for territory.</p>

         <p>
            <pb n="4"/> The Indian war in America is now become an object of
                    considerable importance, by the junction of several tribes of
                    Indians, hitherto ???with those already engaged in it. General Washington is
                    expected to take the command of the army intended to serve against them in
                    the present summer.</p>

            <pb n="6"/> Letters dated Halifax, Feb 7, brought by the Schooner Joseph,
                    arrived at Glasgow, say, the Indians have beat the Americans in
                    a second action, in which 48 officers and 800 men were killed of the
                    American army, besides the loss of all their field pieces, arms and stores.
                    since this battle, the Indians are increasing, and become very powerful.</p>

            <pb n="2"/> The brig Virginia Planter, James Merrifield, Master, arrived at
                    Liverpool, brings information that on the 5th of May, General Wayne, with
                    two thousand provincials, had attacked totally destroyed
                    most of the Indian towns at the back of Georgia, for near two hundred miles
                        around the river. That M'Gilvray, and his army of savages, after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement, had fled to
                    the woods, where the General left them, and returned to Savannah.–
                    This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of
                    March, winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe, and though the
                    Cherokee, Miami, and Chiquesaw tribes, may mediate revenge
                    at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to
                    disturb the settlers for some years to come.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>From theJamaica
                            Royal Gazette.Kingston, Nov. 28.</p>
         <p>By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that the people are in quietness,
                    but still armed; and that the Governor, who had been suffered to remain, but the Intendent only having fled, is perfectly submissive to the will of the people.</p>
         <p>For several days last week the weather at the north side, and in some of the
                    Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold
                    is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees
                    have been thrown down, but we have yet heard of no material damage.</p>
         <p>The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th
                    regiment of foot, consisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates,
                    having received them from on board the ship Commerce, Foot,
                    from London, off the East End on Thursday last, the Commerce
                    being destined for Savanna la Mar.</p>
         <p>Dec. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion, Captain Nichols, returned to Port-Royal from the
                    Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was
                    prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port.
                    Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken
                    place amongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the
                    Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country,
                    which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so apprehensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents, should
                    they possess themselves of any of those strong holds.</p>
         <p>We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with the Indians, to negotiate with
                    Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States,
                    has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors
                    have declared, that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the
                        rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding,
                    that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their
                    claim to the district in question, as it is founded in
                    usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident, as it is known that he wishes to
                    establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well for thecommercial emolument, as
                    for the civilization of his countrymen, by an intercourse with
                    foreign States.</p>

         <p>The abolition ofNegro slavery, which has taken shape in the five New England

                    Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland; and
                    the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is
                    to take place on or before the fifth of November, 1795.</p>
         <p>The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the
                    emancipated Negroes of that State, in proportion to the numbers of the
                        respective families, where the liberal and philanthropic
                    mind is gratified, by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms, and
                    form communities of civilized Societies.</p>
         <p>Before the Gentleman, who has favoured us with this Intelligence, left
                    America, they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the

                        magnificence of the Order, where a sermon was preached, on
                    the occasion, by one of their own colour. They have also endowed
                    public schools, employed ??? and
                    erected places of Public Worship.</p>
         <p>The Officers, Non-commissioned Officers, and Soldiers, who served in the
                    Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country, have at last
                    received a reward, infinitely beyond their expectations, but every way
                        corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising
                    Republic.</p>
         <p>Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress, this last
                    Session, to each individual, who served throughout the war; and to the
                    defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature, and
                        eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period;
                    and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value, to the
                    injury of the Patriotic Veteran, as has been the case of former grants, he
                    is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money, at the present
                    market price, from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land,
                    and the rest in money,a s may be most agreeable to the receiver.</p>
         <p>The Mint of the United States, which was established two years
                    since, has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been
                    delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles, half eagles, and quarter
                    eagles.</p>
         <p>The first is exactly five and forty shillings, English money, or ten
                    American coin.</p>
         <p>The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half, and quater, which
                    makes the courie of exchange simple, and suits the reckoning to a very
                    capacity–as our Readers will perceive, that ten quarter
                    dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle;
                    and ten dollars the eagle.</p>
         <p>There is, besides, one more silver coin, which is called a Dime,
                    and is the tenth part of a dollar.</p>
         <p>The copper coin is called a Cent, and is the tenth part of a Dime.</p>
         <p>Six of the ships of war, which were voted by Congress in November
                    last, are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty
                    four will be ready by Midsummer next, and will complete a fleet of
                        ???hundred guns.</p>
         <p>The city of Washington, which in five years more will be the Capital of the
                    United States, will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol
                    or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence, and
                        c??? a full and complete view
                    of every part of the city, as well as a considerable extent of the country
                    around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground
                    near the banks of the Potamac, possessing a delightful water prospect,
                    together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material
                    parts of the city.</p>
         <p>From the President's house to the Capitol, run two great pleasure parks or
                    malls, which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the
                    Potomac, and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings
                    for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol, as well
                    as those of the President's house, are of the finest marble. The
                    building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want
                    of stone cutters, masons, bricklayers, carpenters, and
                    blacksmiths, who at this time actually receive the enormous
                    wages of ten shillings American currency per day.</p>
         <p>The district of Country at the back of North Carolina, reaching
                    to the Mississippi, and covering a country six hundred miles long by three
                    hundred broad, is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the
                    Province of Maine, extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the
                    river St. Croix, is expected to form a Seventeenth.</p>
         <p>The new cities build in America since her independence are
                    Grenville, in the State of Georgia; Martenberg, the Capitol of
                    North Carolina; Columbia, the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and
                    Nashville, in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville, Fairfield, and Lexington, in the State of Kentucky; Washington, the Capital of the
                    United States; Sunbury, in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson, upon Husdon's
                    River, and Cooper's Town, in the State of New York; Bennington,
                    in the State of Vermont; and Paterson, in the State of New Jersey. All
                    the towns burnt by the English in the was, have been rebuilt, and the old
                    cities of Charlestown, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, have
                    been extended to more than double the extent they had before the
                    peace.</p>
         <p>The population of the United States, by the last Census in 1790,
                    was more than double what it was in 1775, by which it appears, that America
                    doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from
                    the different nations in Europe to that country, are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms
                    and villages has been so great as to people four new States, and to extend
                    their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South, and from
                    the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.</p>

            <pb n="6"/>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated the 9th May last,
                    mention, that General Wayne had been dispatched, in the beginning of March,
                    on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians,
                    who have, for some time past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray,
                    a Scotchman, who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne,
                    at the head of two thousand Provincials, had completely routed them
                    after a great slaughter. After the battle, Macgillivray and
                    his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most
                    part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English
                    miles along the river, which is the boundary of Georgia, after which he
                    returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put it out
                    of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of
                    Virginia.</p>

      <header>The American States having...</header>
      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>The American States having now gained their independence, have no
                    cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different
                        between them and Spain. It is well known, that the
                    Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and
                    ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, to enable them to
                    distress the Americans, and prove at least a hindrance to their growing
                        prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has
                    been denied them?and the Spaniards, now in possession of the Floridas, have
                    been continually quarrelling with them about their
                    boundaries.</p>
         <p>It may therefore be considered as almost certain, that the
                    American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a
                    great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though
                    American cannot furnish money, she can furnish men and provisions; and
                    afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the
                    security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers, too,
                    will be able to take their runs so speedily, that the Spanish trade must be
                    very materially injured thereby.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="2"/>Kingston, Feb. 6.</p>
         <p>By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn, that the small-pox
                    raged lately at &gt;Surinam, to such a degree that, within the
                    space of two months, upwards of 2500 persons had perished
                    by that disorder.</p>
         <p>A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the
                    evening of last Thursday se'ennight, at the settlements near the
                    Blue Mountains.</p>
         <p>On Wednesday the 3d instant, arrived at Lucca, the ship Pitt,
                    Captain Hunter, from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage
                    from Africa, nine of the seamen mutined, whom Captain Hunter has
                    brought confined in irons, and they are to be tried at a Court of
                        Admiralty Sessions.</p>
         <p>Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans, that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray, and
                    the nations under his immediate controul, or in alliance with him, are
                    subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact, that they are
                    regularly supplied with cloathing, arms and ammunition, from the Royal
                        Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola, and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch,
                    will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the
                    disputes.</p>
         <p>March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port
                    Royal, from Cork, his Majesty's ship Chichester, of 44 guns, armed en flute, Lieutenant Craven, Commander,
                    having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of
                    of foot, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas. The other Officers
                    are–Captains, Duncan, Franer, Pemberton, and Mannoch;
                    Lieutenants, Sir W. Jas. Cockburne, Bart. Nicholson, Puxley, Clunes, Browne, Clarke, Drummond, and Graham; Adjutant, Sir. W. J.
                    Cockburne, Bart. Quartermaster, Mr. Davidson, Surgeon, MR. Young;
                        Ma?e, Mr. Bolton.</p>
         <p>The troops in the Chicester amount to 500 men, exch??e of 100 women and children.</p>
         <p>Colonel Hunter is appointed superintendent of the settlement at the Bay of
                    Honduras, in the room of Colonel Despard, recalled.</p>
         <p>Col. Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore
                    probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between
                        Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the
                    Bay of Honoduras, will be brought to a speedy determination.</p>
         <p>At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estate,a negro
                    blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and
                    sixty pounds!</p>
         <p>At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in
                    this town and at Up Park Camp, and embarked on board the Chichester
                    for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their
                    quarters.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola, that, on the
                    1st of this month, a number of free people of colour, to the amount of 700
                    and upwards, having possessed themselves of several field pieces,
                    formed a camp in that districh, and exhibited an appearance of hostility
                    highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent
                    from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a
                    proceeding, the insurgents demanded, that a remonstrance which
                    they then delivered to the deputies, should be presented imimmediately to the general, and that an answer thereto should be given
                    without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired, proved
                    to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the
                    free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites,
                    with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and  immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation,
                    and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding
                    with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should
                    their demands be treat with neglect.</p>
         <p>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged adviseable to
                    assemble a body of the militia, who headed by the General, immediately went
                    against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to
                    the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed, and one of the
                    ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded.</p>
         <p>A proclamation was then issued, offering a reward of 50 half joes
                    for the head of any principal offender, and in the course of a few days not
                    less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant, a
                    very great majority of those who had formed the camp, finding all their
                        attempts completely frustrated, came in and took the
                    oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals, for whom
                    high rewards are offered, are not yet taken.</p>
         <p>From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the
                    loss of the ship Lion, Capt. Smith, belonging to Liverpool: a violent
                    breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors, and she now lies
                    stranded on the beach.</p>

         <p>The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America
                    being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment, we are particularly happy in being enabled to give
                    some further account of the transactions, that have happened at Nootka
                    Sounds, as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be
                    extended to other places by the means of this trade.</p>
         <p>It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the
                    Northern regions of China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnificent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the
                    Southern Provinces.</p>
         <p>Pekin is, therefore, the proper mart for this valuable commodity, and in
                    this immense city, the consumption is so great, that the produce of
                    the voyage meets and immediate sale.</p>
         <p>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the Emperor himself, are fond of
                    wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's
                    collar to his vestment is a luxury.</p>
         <p>The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a
                    value on woollens of all kinds, that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and
                    stockings, that could be procured in China, if English manufacture, were sold to the Indians, with whose Chiefs treaties of
                    commerce had been formed.</p>
         <p>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's
                    ship deserves to be recorded.</p>
         <p>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a Chief, second in authority at
                    Nootka Sound, was in alliance with the English, he was shot through
                    the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum, with an
                    infant child, escaped, but not till wounded.</p>
         <p>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, retired at the head of
                    the allies of England, from Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the
                    Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they
                    could seize, the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their
                        fortifications.</p>
         <p>At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the
                    Sandwich Islands, with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments.
                    And we further add, on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration,
                    that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain
                    Mears, the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.</p>
         <p>Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of
                    Kamschatka, and other ports belonging to the Russians, with the teas and
                    other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable
                    channel of commerce, as the Chinese have shut their ports against the
                    Russians, who </p>
         <p>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, one of our ships sailed and
                    disposed of her cargo, but was unfortunately lost on her return to
                    China.</p>
         <p>To these curious particulars we add, with a patriot joy, that the
                    consumption of the glorious staple of England, her broad cloths, is
                        astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hardware, &amp;c. is also in great request.</p>
         <p>From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears, ships which touch at the
                    Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This
                    Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of proportionate bulk.

         <p>"Trade is brisk at present, from the high prices and great sales
                    of grain to Europe. Our farmers and giving above 6 s. currency
                    (about 3s. sterling) to workmen per day and their meat, to enable them
                    to take in new grounds, which is a great discouragement to our rising
                    manufactories, which are obliged to give high wages to their
                    journeymen on that account.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. Doylden from Europe has lately purchased two millions of
                    acres of lands from Congress, Mr. Scriba, merchant in New York,
                    has purchased four millions of acres, all from Congress, a
                    society of gentlemen, with whom, it is said, some Dutch houses in Amsterdam
                    are concerned, have purchased from the State of Georgia about fifteen
                    millions of land on the frontiers of that State. The very highest price
                    paid for any of these purchases has been twenty cents per acre, (about
                    ten-pence British money) payable by installments at different
                    periods, and that in Congress money." </p>

            <pb n="3"/>Richmond, Virginia, Dec. 1, 1790.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Kentucky, to a
                        Member of the General Assembly, dated, Nov. 7, 1790.</p>
         <p>"I have been waiting with much impatience to obtain some certain account of
                    our troops; many probably conjectures still fill the minds of the
                    people. A hand-bill just come to Bourbon, contains an
                    extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson, which mentions that our army had met with
                    but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned, from thence a
                    detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river, which fell in with a
                    party of Indians, and had a severe engagement.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar made a shew of retreating, and marched about eight miles,
                    when he detached a strong party to the field of action, in hopes of
                    finding the Indians on the ground; as they expected, so
                    they found them, and an action immediately commenced, which was
                    obstinate on both sides.</p>
         <p>"A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river.
                    Major Fountain, of Fayette, and General Scott's son were killed the
                    second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen were killed; Major
                    Willis, Lieut. Fotheringham, of the F–deral troops, and
                    77 privates, also fell in the action.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment,
                    consisting of 400 men, (who had to sustain the fire of the whole
                    Indian army) although he had with him in camp upwards of 1100 men. Our
                    men at last lost ground, Colonel Harding's wing was beaten, and
                    finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall, of Bourbon, and
                    Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other wing of the Indians, which
                    occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.</p>
         <p>"General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded, nor bury the dead.
                    Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon
                    militia has suffered very much, nearly one third of them having fallen on
                    the spot.</p>
         <p>"The army is now at Licking, and is expected home hourly.</p>
         <p>"This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be
                    delivered to you by Major Jones, who before he leaves the district,
                    may be enabled to obtain further particulars."</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>Musquito Shore.Intelligence has been received, that in some trivial dispute with a
                    native Indian, a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and
                    then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged, being
                    made acquainted with the murder, sent a deputation to the Governor,
                    demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an
                    attonement. This was peremptorily refused, as being more than
                    commensurate to the offence, but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly, and
                    departed, vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence
                    was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, who
                    had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed, the Spaniards
                    were flying, with the utmost precipitation and terror, from all parts
                    of the country, seeking shelter in the forts.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="3"/>Norfolk, April 11. This day arrived the ship
                    Albion, John Simmons, master, in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th
                    lying to in a heavy gale of wind, the Albion shipped a sea, which carried
                    away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were
                    three men of the watch, one of whom is washed overboard and
                    perished– his name is John M'Naught, and belonged to
                    Greenock.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the
                        Ohio, to his relation in Winchester,
                        Virginia. dated April 13, 1791.</p>
         <p>"I wrote to you from Fort Pitt, which place we left the 3d. inst. in company
                    with two other boats, and proceeded to Limestone, without meeting or
                    apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several
                    disasters which had befallen boats going down the river, and one to a
                    boat going up to a French station, loaded with bacon, butter, &amp;c. The
                    particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was
                    attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians, and the flankets that were on
                    shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing,
                    they gave the Indian whoop, and rushing on the flankets, scalped them
                    every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat, but did no
                    damage, as it required some time to make their way into the river. After
                    the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity,
                    they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of
                    about six days, five or six boats happened to come down the
                    river–the savages attacked the foremost of them, in which were
                    two young ladies, of the name Macdonald, a young gentleman, and some
                    others, passengers, and took it. Elevated with this easy capture, they
                    imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in
                    with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight, which they
                    attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes, each canoe
                    containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat, as
                    it came down, and commenced firing; after discharging their guns, they
                        retreated, loading and came on a second time, fired and
                    repeated nine different times; as often as they come on, there was a
                    brisk firing kept up from the boat, which contained nine fighting
                    men;– during the conflict two were killed, and five wounded;
                    two only remained to protect the boat, and prevent the Indians from
                    boarding it, which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in
                    a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ???, they threw billets of wood at them, and
                    one of them took up an ax, as a weapon of defence, should
                    they persist in boarding, which the Indians perceiving, and, as is
                    supposed, their ammunition being expended, they retreated, without
                    accomplishing their object.</p>
         <p>"These inhuman monsters, previous to their attacking the last mentioned
                    boat, placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes, in which
                    situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction, they
                    fired at another boat, and killed one young man. In short, every boat
                    tat has gone down the river lately, has been fired at, except our's. We saw
                    no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened
                    we passed in the night."</p>
         <p>Boston, May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston, lost 25,000 dollars in the late lottery;
                    besides 'wear and tear' of conscience.</p>
         <p>Salem, May 31. His excellency our worthy overnor
                    perceiving, with his usual discernment, that Lotteries have a tendency to
                    withdraw the people's attention from industry, the only certain source
                    of wealth and prosperity; and also that they operate as a ??? ??? ???, ???
                        ???and embarrassed being ??? the ??? aventurers; suggests, in ??? ??? the
                    Legislature, the propriety of discontinuing this mode of raising
                    money.</p>
         <p>The states of Connecticut and New Hampshire have passed laws, prohibiting
                    the sale of lottery tickets of other states, in their states.</p>
         <p>Bennington, May 30. A gentleman from the northward
                    informs, that the part at the British post lately holden in this state, has
                    recently been recalled.</p>
         <p>Baltimore, May 27. Colonel Jacob Webb, and Captain
                    Miller, formerly of Stamford, in Concecticut, Mr. John Carmel,
                    of Philadelphia, merchant, and several other gentlemen, with a
                    negro boy, were drowned, on the 9th of March last, in St. Mary's river
                    (Georgia) occasioned by the oversetting of a boat, in a sudden
                    flaw of wind.</p>
         <p>Boston, May 25. On Friday last, the venerable Mr. John Simonds, of Salem, entered the one
                        hundredth year of his age. He is the only male person who has
                    arrived at that great age from the first settlement of the town by the
                        English, in 1629, to the present day.</p>
         <p>New York, June 9.</p>
         <p>General Washington, on his tour to the Southern Sates, landed at
                    Charlestown, South Carolina, in a barge decorated for the
                    purpose, with colours and pendants, and rowed by twelve American Captains and a Cockswain, all dressed in blue silk jackets, black
                    silk breeches, white stockings, and blue roses to their shoes.
                    They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus, with the
                    motto, Long live the President. An immense
                    number of people assembled near the Quay, and on board the vessels in
                    the river, which, as well as works, saluted him with several discharges of
                    artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The
                    lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–</p>
         <p>"Right Worshipful Sir, "We the Master, Officers and Membersof St. John's Lodge, No. 2 of Newbern, beg leave to hail you welcome
                    with three times three! We approach you not with
                    the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother, the skilful and expert Craftsmen, the just and upright Man.</p>
         <p>But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient
                    energy, the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We
                    therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray,
                    that the Providence of the Most High, may strengthen, establish and protect
                    you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from
                    your terrestrial labours, by command of our divine grand master, and your operations sealed with the mark of
                    his approbation, may your soul be
                    everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from
                    the right hand of God. And when the Supreme
                    Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious
                    jewels, as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you
                    eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre."</p>
         <p>To which the President returned the following answer:– "Gentlemen, "I receive the cordial welcome which you
                    are pleased to give me, with sincere gratitude. My best ambition
                    having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens, it is
                    peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved,, by a fraternity whose association is founded on
                    justice and benevolence.</p>
         <p>In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address, be
                    persuaded, that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future
                        happiness."</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="4"/>George-Town. April 30.</p>
         <p>Yesterday morning, about one or two o'clock, the ship Termagant, belonging
                    to the house of Messrs. Claggen, lying in the stream opposite this
                    town, was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and
                    the seamen in the harbour speedily collected, but on account of a quantity
                    of powder that was on board, the efforts that otherwise
                    would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first
                    soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion
                    was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The
                    cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction, and it
                    and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting, store and
                    dwelling houses, on the water side, were prevented from sharing a similar
                    fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse, the
                    property of Francis and Charles Loundes, situated at some
                    distance from the water, wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were
                        stored, was several times, in different places, on fire,
                    ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss,
                    occasioned by this alarming element, must be great indeed, as the ship was
                    large and nearly new; besides, there were goods to a considerable
                    amount, and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which
                        (excepting a part of the money, which has since been
                    found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded
                    from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the
                        cabbin, which by some means or other, set fire to the
                    sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was
                    discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.</p>
         <p>Pittsburgh, May 21. A letter received in this town,
                    on Sunday last, from Lieut. Jeffers, at Fort Franklin, mentions, that an
                    Indian had arrived there, who brought him intelligence that
                    300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and
                    that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio,
                    near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing, but their
                    destination was not known.</p>

            <pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from
                    Philadelphia and New York we have informmation, that the Indians
                    are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of
                    the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the
                    miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress, and an army was collected
                    this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
         <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York
                    state by a majority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were
                    objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not opened the boxes
                    which contained the returns from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and
                    Tioga, which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr.
                    Tay, the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr.
                    Tay.</p>
         <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July, which continued
                    with so much violence, that several vessels were driven from their
                    moorings, and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.</p>

         <p>A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians,
                    commanded by one of their greatest Warriors, who was left dead on the
                    field, amongst many hundreds of his followers.</p>
         <p>The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June, by a company of
                    Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New
                    York, aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants;
                    and after a contest of three hours, put them totally to the rout. The
                    carnage was general amongst the Indians, and no quarter given,
                    as it might operate as a terror in future to those savage Freebooters,
                    whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and
                    oftentimes ??? with personal
                    cruelty to those in their power, has exasperated the Communities to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an
                    opportunity offered.</p>

            <pb n="5"/>Extract of a letter from Luxene
                            County."On Saturday the 1st of July, I left Tioga point, near the middle of
                    the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising
                    from the north west, and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the
                    house of Obadiah Gore, Esq; at Sheshequen, before the storm came on,
                    attended with heavy thunder and lightening, and a violent gale of wind
                    with rain. The storm continued upwards of half an hour, during which time to see the tumbling of timber
                    during the storm, was surprising. After it abated I continued on
                    my journey, but found it very difficult travelling in many
                    places, the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached
                    Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the
                    country, and at the same hour of the day, blew more violent in some
                    places than others. At Exeeter, about nine miles from
                    Wilksbarrie, a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber, was swept of
                    its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length, and
                    three fourths of a mile wide, being either torn up by the roots or twisted
                    off, leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.</p>
         <p>"A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their
                    roofs, and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed, and
                    many fields of corn, others grain and flax laid level with the
                    earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every
                    part of the country.</p>
         <p>"A Mr. –Lot, who lived at Mahooper, about 35 miles from Wilksbarre,
                    whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he
                    with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger
                    in the house, left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree
                    reached them a small distance from the door, and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and
                    both arms broke, another badly wounded in the head–these
                    two it is feared has received the fatal blow, two other slightly
                    wounded."</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Richmond, Virginia,
                            dated July 28.</p>
         <p>"By accounts from Kentucky we are informed, that about the 1st of
                    this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort, and took a great
                    number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them
                    to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river,
                    leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or
                    15 miles, overtook a large party, when a severe engagement ensued, but
                    being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat. He then
                    sent for the men left behind, and came up with the Indians the next
                    day, and after engaging some time, obliged them to make a precipitate
                    retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors, two Englishmen and a
                    Frenchman from Detroit, and all the negroes and horses."</p>
         <p>Newtown, June 27.</p>
         <p>On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown, was removed
                    about eight rods, the removal was effected in one hour and an
                    half, after previous preparations for the purpose had been made. The
                    house is between 70 and 80 feet long, and about 50 feet wide, with a
                    steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire,
                    with the least injury to any part.</p>

            <pb n="2"/> Each day brings additional strength to the report of
                    a rupture with America. The representations which have been very
                    forcibly urged by the American Minister, Mr. Pinckney, include various
                    topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the withholding of
                    the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in violation of the treaty of 1783;
                    the exciting of the Creek and other Indians to make war upon the
                    American frontier; the refusal to make compensation for the
                    property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwallis, &amp;c in the Southern
                    States, according to stipulation; the seizure of American
                    ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens
                    to man our fleets; and finally, the sullen silence which the British
                    Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject
                    of the claims made by the Republic.</p>
         <p>The American Minister has, however, so little hope of efficacy from these
                    representations, that he has ordered in his tradesman's bills, and made
                    every other preparation for an abrupt departure.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding this a??miny aspect of
                    affairs, we still must hope, that no consequences subversive of the
                    pacific system at present subsisting between America and Great Britain will
                    ensue; for illjudged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests
                    of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank( who would
                    advise another American war –a war which, reasoning of the future by
                    the sorrowful experience of the past, can only serve to increase the
                    sum, and to swell the catalogue of human woe.</p>

                    from thence to China, but was cut off and plundered, on the night of the
                    10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island
                    of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five
                    of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with
                    some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and
                    the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift, by
                    which means she drove on shore through a heavy surf, and was soon
                    bilged and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was
                    impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in
                    the design of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have
                    been a constant practise among the different natives towards one
                    another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore,
                    through stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder; but had no hesitation in
                    permitting the plunder of the vessel– The crew were informed by such
                    expressions as they could understand, as well as by gesticulations
                    that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their
                    lives were dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed to many other
                    chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far superior
                    in number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the
                    exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was
                    seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been
                    called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish
                    of the people, as it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity.
                    His people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length
                    peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a
                    length of time opposed by the force of words, which not seeming likely to
                        prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole
                    in an instant, and saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding
                    that all his expostulations were defeated, on the principle of
                    undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were near
                    him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his own,
                    called to the chief next in command, who immediately
                    approached him. His conference was short and decisive: he first pointed to
                    the cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other
                    which he had entwined around his own. "These strangers are doomed to
                    death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that
                    I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my
                    child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then
                    it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the
                    destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled
                    with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly excel
                    his fellow- creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment
                    the people looked wildly upon their king, whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his
                    government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of
                    strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at
                    the change which a few moments had produced; The mandate which had
                    proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and, commanded to
                    perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey when a sudden
                    shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The
                    King! the King!" from every lip burst forth–'What! kill the King!
                    No, no, let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the King!"
                    Thus were their lives preserved, and the vessel plundered of every thing on
                    board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Noorheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by
                    the natives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well
                    ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling
                    chief. The rebels are denominated the typees; and the opposite parties
                    are horribly sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were
                    killed and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them,
                    and the following detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion: A native man belonging
                    to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of death,
                    impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and
                    darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury,
                    exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet coagulated.</p>
         <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a
                    canoe, and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists
                    merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the
                    shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer
                    than the Taheitan women. The chiefs have no distinguishing mark or
                    ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common
                    orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of
                    which, extending from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is
                    kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler
                    supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the
                    ship's bottoms there than he has any where else witnessed; and to this
                    cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up
                    their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors.
                    They are anxious after every kind of property carried among them
                    for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for
                    attacking vessels, when they can do so with a probability of accomplishing
                    their object.– They have no knowledge of the use of muskets,
                    and have none among them except a few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman,
                    at this time in Sydney, who resided among them about fifteen
                    years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes them as a people
                    constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for
                    taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very numerous;
                    which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing at the same time, that its inhabitants were less numerous:–" Can't we go and take them?-
                    What is there to hinder us?" was immediately demanded. This anecdote we
                        notice as a specimen of their natural inclination to
                    hostility, in which, all accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

                        1815.]</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew
                    of the India brig Matilda, which sailed from this Colony in August 1813,
                    bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from thence to
                    China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of April
                    last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one
                    of the Marquessas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of

                    appears to have been a constant practise among the different islanders
                    towards one another, when their canoes happen by accident to fall upon
                    a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident.
                    Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their chief, or king, Nooakretu,

                    deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one
                    round the neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the chief
                    next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was
                    short and decisive: he first pointed to the cord that encircled the
                    neck of his son, and then to the other which he had entwined around his
                    own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and
                    my people: and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see
                    so vile a deed per petrated. Let my child and myself be strangled
                    before it is performed and then it never will be said that we
                    sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these
                    unoffending people." The magnanimity of such a conduct could not
                    do less than produce, even in the mind of the unenlightened savage, a
                    paroxysm of surprise, mingled with a sentiment of admiration in
                    which the untaught man may possibly excel his fellow creature - whose
                    concep tions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the
                    extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King,
                    whose person they adored, because that his principles were good, and
                    his government just and mild. They saw the obedient chief,
                    to whom the order of strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror
                    and amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; The
                    mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed: and,
                    commanded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to
                    obey– when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to
                    forbearance. "The King! The King!" from every lip burst
                    forth:–'What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers live: no
                    man shall kill the King!"–Thus were their lives preserved–and
                    the vessel plundered of everything on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                    natives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these metals.
                    That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions,
                    and make war upon the ruling chief. The rebels are deno minated the
                        Typees; and the opposite parties are horribly
                    sanguinary towards each other. Six of the adverse party were killed and
                    devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the
                    following detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion. A native
                    man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattoo'd, and in consequence
                    prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on pain of death, impatient
                    of the restraint, fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his
                    teeth into it in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the
                    crimson moisture, which had not yet coagulated.</p>
         <p>The chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a
                    canoe, and the latter signifying Great.– The
                    dress, of the men consists merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women
                    are covered from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are gene
                    rally fairer than the Tahitian women. The chiefs have no
                    distinguishing mark or ornament, but in the mode of wearing their hair;
                    which the common orders wear tied up in a large knot on each side of
                    the head, a stripe of which, extending from the forehead to the hollow
                    of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the chiefs do not adopt. Capt.
                        Fowler supposes the worms to be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there, than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the
                    caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of
                    which contain from 80 to 100 war riors. They are anxious after every kind
                    of property carried among them for barter, and this is
                    supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when
                    they can do so with a probability of ac complishing their object. They have
                    no knowledge of the use of muskets; and have none among them except a
                    few at Port Anna Maria. A gentleman at this time in Sydney, who resided
                    among them about 15 years ago in a Missionary capacity, describes them
                    as a people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes for taking advantage of
                    strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to some of
                    them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing at the same
                    time that its inhabitants were less numerous:–"Can't we go and take them?–what is there to hinder
                        us?"–was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as a
                    specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which,
                    all accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

                        MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OFTHE MARQUESAS ISLANDS.(From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8,
                        1815.)</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew
                    of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in
                    August, 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands,
                    and from thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on
                    the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay,
                    at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a sandal wood voyage.
                    Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining
                    with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night,
                    and the wind blowing fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by
                    which means she drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged
                    and filled with water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was
                    impracticable to get the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the
                    design of putting the whole of her crew to death, which appears to have been a constant practise among the different
                    natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a
                    strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate
                    mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the
                        murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of
                    the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as
                    they could understand, as well as by gesticulations that
                    accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were
                    dependent on the issue; the good chief was opposed by many other Chiefs,
                    who, though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far superior in
                    number, supported by the common usages of the island, from which the
                    exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was seated,
                    with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had been
                    called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the people, as
                    it was not a hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed
                    their solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed
                    by the force of words, which not seeming likely to prevail, he
                    adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and
                    saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that were
                    near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other round his
                    own, called to the Chief next in command, who immediately approached him.
                    His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord
                    that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other which he had
                    entwined around his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said he,
                    "by my chiefs and my people: and it is not fit that I, who am their
                    King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my
                    child and myself be strangled before it is performed and then it never will
                    be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the destruction of
                    these unoffending people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man
                    may possibly excel his fellow creature, whose conceptions are moulded
                    by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a
                    moment the people looked wildly upon their King, whose person they adored,
                        because that his principles were good, and his government
                    just and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of
                    strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the
                    change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed: and commanded
                    to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when
                    a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the
                    King!" from every lip burst forth:–"What! kill the King! No,
                    no, let all the strangers live–no man shall kill the
                    King!"–Thus were their lives preserved and the vessel plundered
                    of every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the
                    natives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct

                    each. Six of the adverse party were killed, and devoured by
                    the rebels while Captain Fowler was among them, and the following
                    detestable circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A
                    native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in
                        consequence prohibited from the eating of human flesh, on
                    pain of death, impatient of the restraint, fell upon one of the
                    murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in all the madness of a
                    voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which had not yet
                    coagulated.</p>

                    cord that encircled the neck of his son, and then to the other, which
                    he had entwined around his own. "These strangers are doomed to death," said
                    he, "by my chiefs and my people, and it is not fit that I, who am their
                    King, should live to see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and
                    myself be strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be
                    said that we sanctioned, even with our eye- sight, the destruction of these
                    unoffending people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise, mingled with
                    a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may possibly
                    excel his fellow creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets
                    calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a
                    moment the people looked wildly upon their King, whose person they adored,
                    because that his principles were good, and his government just
                    and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of
                    strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at
                    the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had proceeded
                    from the King's own lips must be obeyed;and commanded to perform the
                    dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a sudden shout from the
                    multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the King!" from every lip
                    burst forth:– "What! kill the King! No, no, let all the strangers
                    live –no man shall kill the King!" Thus were their lives
                    preserved and the vessel plundered of every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron
                    and copper have been taken out by the natives, who have a thorough
                    knowledge of the use of these materials. That they are cannibals is well
                    ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the
                    ruling Chief; the rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposing
                        parties are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the
                        adverse party were killed, and devoured by the rebels while
                    Captain Fowler was among them, and the following detestable
                    circumstance occurred on the occasion:–A native man belonging to
                    Port Anna Maria, who was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from
                    the eating of human flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the restraint,
                    fell upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it in
                    all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture,
                    which had not yet coagulated.</p>
         <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the latter signifying great. The dress, of the men consists merely
                    of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered from the shoulders
                    downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than the
                    Taheitan women. The Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but in
                    the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied up
                    in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which, extending from
                    the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn, which practice the
                    Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms to be more
                    prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there, than he has
                    anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the
                    natives in drawing up their largest canoes, some of which contain from 80
                    to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every kind of property carried
                    among them for barter, and this is supposed their chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a
                    probability of accomplishing their object. They have no knowledge of
                    the use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna
                    Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among
                    them about 15 years ago in a missionary capacity, describes them as a
                    people constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising schemes
                    for taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very numerous; which he remarked to
                    some of them, to whom he gave a description of Otaheite, observing, at the
                    same time, that its inhabitants were less
                    numerous:–"Cannot we go and take them? What is there to hinder
                    us?"–was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice as
                    a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all
                    accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

            <pb n="1"/>ANOTHER DREADFUL MASSACRE BY THE NATIVES OFTHE MARQUESAS ISLANDS.[From the Sydney Gazette, November 8, 1815]</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part of the crew of the India brig Matilda, which sailed
                    from this colony in August, 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and
                    Eastern Islands, and from thence to China; but was cut off and
                    plundered on the night of the 10th of April last, while lying at anchor in
                    Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah, one of the Marquesas, on a
                    sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew (Poomootoo men) had previously
                    deserted, and joining with some of the Rooapoah natives, took the
                    opportunity of a dark night, and the wind blowing fresh right on the
                    land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she drove ashore
                    through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with water. When the
                    cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get the vessel afloat,
                    they concurred universally in the design of putting the whole of her crew
                    to death; which appears to have been a constant practise among the
                    different natives towards one another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through stress of weather, or from any
                    other accident.</p>
         <p>Captain Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or King, Nooahetu,
                    who presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the unfortunate
                    mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the murder;
                    but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of the vessel. The crew
                    were informed by such expressions as they could understand, as well as
                    by gesticulations that accompanied their vehement debate on the occasion,
                    that their lives were dependent on the issue; the good Chief was
                    opposed by many other Chiefs, who, though somewhat inferior in rank,
                    were very far superior in number, supported by the common usages of the
                    island, from which the exhibition of clemency appeared an insufferable
                        deviation. He was seated, with his son by his side, on
                    a mat in his own dwelling; he had been called to the supremacy of the
                    island by the general wish of the people, as it was not an hereditary
                    right, but an elective dignity. His people pressed their
                    solicitations earnestly, and at length peremptorily demanded his
                    assent to the sacrifice; which he for a length of time opposed by the
                    force of words; which not seeming likely to prevail, he adopted a method
                    which silenced the whole in an instant, and saved the lives of Captain Fowler and his crew. Finding that
                    all his expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom, he deliberately took up two ropes that
                    were near him, and fixing one round the neck of his son, and the other
                    round his own, called to the Chief next in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of his son,
                    and then to the other, which he had entwined round his own. "These
                    strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people,
                    and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a
                    deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before it is
                    performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even
                    with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending
                    people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may
                    possibly excel his fellow-creature–whose conceptions are moulded by
                    tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King, whose person

                    amazement at the change which a few moments had produced; the
                    mandate that had proceeded from the King's own lips must be
                    obeyed; and commanded to perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to
                    obey–when a sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance.
                    "The King! the King!" from every lip burst forth– "What! kill
                    the King! No, no, let all the strangers live –no man shall kill the
                    King!" Thus were their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of
                    every thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the

                    Fowler, and part of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in August, 1813, bound on

                    strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my chiefs and my people, and
                    it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to see so vile a deed
                        perpetrated. Let my child and myself be strangled before
                    it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned,
                    even with our eye-sight, the destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sentiment of admiration in which the untaught man may
                    possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose conceptions are moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of
                    passion. For a moment the people looked wildly upon their King, whose
                    person they adored, because that his principles were good, and his
                    government just and mild. They saw the obedient Chief, to whom the order
                    of strangulation had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement
                    at the change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that had
                    proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to
                    perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a sudden
                    shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King! the
                    King!" from every lip burst forth– "What! kill the King! No, no, let
                    all the strangers live –no man shall kill the King!" Thus
                    were their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of every thing
                    on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still
                    remains, and is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken
                    out by the natives, who have a thorough knowledge of the use of these
                    materials. That they are cannibals is well ascertained. They form distinct factions, and make war upon the ruling Chief; the
                    rebels are denominated the Typees; and the opposite parties
                    are horribly sanguinary towards each. Six of the adverse party
                    were killed, and devoured by the rebels while Captain Fowler was among
                    them, and the following detestable circumstance occurred on the
                    occasion:–A native man belonging to Port Anna Maria, who
                    was not tattooed, and in consequence prohibited from the eating of
                    human flesh, on pain of death, impatient of the restraint, fell
                    upon one of the murdered bodies, and darting his teeth into it
                    in all the madness of a voracious fury, exhaled the crimson moisture, which
                    had not yet coagulated.</p>
         <p>The Chief of Port Anna Maria, who is very friendly to Europeans, is named
                    Ke-atta-nooe, the first part of the name implying the outrigger of a canoe,
                    and the latter signifying great. The dress of the men consists
                    merely of a wrapper about the waist; the women are covered
                    from the shoulders downwards to the ancles, and are generally fairer than
                    the Taheitan women. The Chiefs have no distinguishing mark or ornament, but
                    in the mode of wearing their hair; which the common orders wear tied
                    up in a large knot on each side of the head, a stripe of which, extending
                    from the forehead to the hollow of the neck, is kept shorn,
                    which practice the Chiefs do not adopt. Captain Fowler supposes the worms
                    to be more prevalent and destructive to the ships' bottoms there,
                    than he has anywhere else witnessed; and to this cause attributes the caution of the natives in drawing up their largest canoes,
                    some of which contain from 80 to 100 warriors. They are anxious after every
                    kind of property carried among them for barter, and this is supposed their
                    chief inducement for attacking vessels when they can do so with a
                    probability of accomplishing their object. They have no knowledge of the
                    use of muskets, and have none among them except a few at Port Anna
                    Maria. A gentleman, at this time in Sydney, who resided among them
                    about 15 years ago, in a missionary capacity, describes them as a people
                    constantly employing their thoughts on plunder, and devising
                    schemes for taking advantage of strangers. Their population is very
                    numerous; which he remarked to some of them, to whom he gave a
                    description of Otaheite; observing, at the same time, that its inhabitants were
                    less numerous:–"Cannot we go and take them?–What is there to
                    hinder us?"– was immediately demanded. This anecdote we notice
                    as a specimen of their natural inclination to hostility, in which, all
                    accounts respecting them correspond.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>British Vessel plundered by the Natives of
                            the Marquesas Islands.[From the Sydney Gazette, Nov. 8, 1815.]</p>
         <p>By the Governor Macquarrie are arrived Captain Fowler, and part
                    of the crew of the Indian brig Matilda, which sailed from this colony in
                    August 1813, bound on a voyage to the Derwent and Eastern Islands, and from
                    thence to China; but was cut off and plundered on the night of the 10th of
                    April last, while lying at anchor in Duff's Bay, at the Island of Rooapoah,
                    one of the Marquesas, on a sandal-wood voyage. Five of the crew
                    (Poomootoo men) had previously deserted, and joining with some of the
                    Rooapoah natives, took the opportunity of a dark night, and the wind blowing
                    fresh right on the land, to cut the vessel adrift; by which means she
                    drove ashore through a heavy surf, and was soon bilged and filled with
                    water. When the cannibal natives saw that it was impracticable to get
                    the vessel afloat, they concurred universally in the design
                    of putting the whole of her crew to death; which appears to have been a
                    constant practise among the different natives towards one
                    another, when their canoes happen to fall upon a strange shore, through
                    stress of weather, or from any other accident.</p>
         <p>Capt. Fowler had formed an intimacy with their Chief, or King, Nooahetu, who
                    presided at the horrible tribunal that had devoted the
                    unfortunate mariners to instant slaughter. He withheld his assent to the
                    murder; but had no hesitation in permitting the plunder of
                    the vessel. The crew were informed by such expressions as they
                    could understand, as well as by gesticulations that accompanied
                    their vehement debate on the occasion, that their lives were dependent on
                    the issue; the good Chief was opposed by many other Chiefs, who,
                    though somewhat inferior in rank, were very far superior in number,
                    supported by the common usages of the island, from which the exhibition of
                        clemency appeared an insufferable deviation. He was
                    seated, with his son by his side, on a mat in his own dwelling; he had
                    been called to the supremacy of the island by the general wish of the
                    people, as it was not an hereditary right, but an elective dignity. His
                        people pressed their solicitations earnestly, and at length
                    peremptorily demanded his assent to the sacrifice; which he for a
                    length of time opposed by the force of words, which not seeming likely to
                    prevail, he adopted a method which silenced the whole in an instant, and
                    saved the lives of Capt. Fowler and his crew. Finding that all his
                    expostulations were defeated upon the principle of undeviating custom, he
                    deliberately took up two ropes that were near him, and fixing one round the
                    neck of his son, and the other round his own, called to the Chief next
                    in command, who immediately approached him. His conference was
                    short and decisive; he first pointed to the cord that encircled the neck of
                    his son, and then to the other, which he had entwined round his own.
                    "These strangers are doomed to death," said he, "by my Chiefs and my
                    people, and it is not fit that I, who am their King, should live to
                    see so vile a deed perpetrated. Let my child and myself be
                    strangled before it is performed; and then it never will be said that we sanctioned, even with our eye-sight, the
                    destruction of these unoffending people."</p>
         <p>The magnanimity of such a conduct could not do less than produce, even in
                    the mind of the unenlightened savage, a paroxysm of surprise,
                    mingled with a sentiment of admiration, in which the untaught man may
                    possibly excel his fellow-creature, whose conceptions are
                    moulded by tenets calculated to guard him from the extremes of passion. For
                    a moment the people looked wildly upon their King, whose person they
                    adored, because that his principles were good, and his government just
                    and mild. They saw the obedient chief, to whom the order of strangulation
                    had been imparted, staring with horror and amazement at the
                    change which a few moments had produced; the mandate that
                    had proceeded from the King's own lips must be obeyed; and commanded to
                    perform the dreadful office, he proceeded to obey–when a
                    sudden shout from the multitude awed him to forbearance. "The King!
                    the King!" from every lip burst forth– "What! kill the King! No, no,
                    let all the strangers live –no man shall kill the King!" Thus were
                    their lives preserved–and the vessel plundered of every
                    thing on board her.</p>
         <p>The floor of the Greenwich, which was burnt at Nooaheva, still remains, and
                    is dry at low water. All her iron and copper have been taken out by the

         <p>
            <pb n="2"/>Each day brings additional strength to the report of
                    a rupture with America. The representtations which have been
                    very forcibly urged by the American Minister, Mr. Pickney, include various
                    topics of complaint. Amongst these are, the withholding of
                    the poste of Niagara, Detroit, &amp;c. in violation of the treat of 1783;
                    the exciting of of the Creek and other Indians to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwalis, &amp;
                    in the Southern States, according to stipulation; the seizure of
                    American ships bound to France; the impressing of American
                    citizens to man our fleets; and finally, the sullen silence which the
                    British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the
                    subject of the claims made by the Republic. </p>
         <p>The American Minister has, however, so little hope of efficacy from these
                    representations, that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills, and made
                    every other preparation for an abrupt departure. </p>
         <p>Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs, we still must hope, that
                    no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting
                    between American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-judged and ignorant, indeed, of the true interests of his country must
                    that Briton be (whatever his rank) who would advise another American war
                    –a war which, reasoning of the future by the sorrowful
                    experience of the past, can only serve to increase the sum, and to swell
                    the catalogue of human woes.</p>

            <pb n="1"/>Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Septemper 10, 1821</p>
         <p> "Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town;
                    6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about
                    1200 Europeans, and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks
                    and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never
                    saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery
                    than in any town of the size in the world.–There are some few
                    splendid houses, but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you
                    cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as
                    in all American towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of
                    water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate
                    must be bad, for the whole population look as if turned out of the
                    hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their
                    faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague
                    very general, with fever–their habits and manner of
                    living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights
                    very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a
                    thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however
                    is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate, if
                    the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook
                    at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in
                    pulperias, and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine
                    on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse themselves
                    for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the
                    same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty
                    doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling,
                    debauchery, and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady
                    takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is
                    quite at good as her neighbours, and needs be no better. The
                    Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South
                    America; every Viceroy, from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher
                    of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people
                    seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady
                    can read or write, or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not
                    appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by
                    the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to
                    priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is
                    covered with churches, some of them very splendid. The whole
                    trade of this part of Peru depends on the  single mine of the mountain of
                    Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage, it will produce six
                    millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war, not a dollar
                    will they have. The exports of Peru, in ordinary times, were five
                    millions of dollars in pecie, and one million inproduce. Mininng may be
                    carried to any extent, it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good
                    government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or
                    Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar." </p>
         <p> "Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to Upper Peru, is a
                    wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and
                    Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the
                    ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on
                    bulsa, (two bladders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We
                    could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to
                    fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety
                    hours, offering them any price for their tropical fruits. </p>
         <p> "I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on the ground;
                    borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern;
                    never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at
                    eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable
                    ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the
                    chandelier; the house filled with smoke. </p>
         <p> "There are 82 titled families, mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty
                    by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year, Peru
                    will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the
                    Indians will regain their empire, and exterminate all other
                    colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy
                    thousand–25,000 in Lima and adjacent village, the total population
                    of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. </p>
         <p> "About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses.
                    Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in the greatest variety; fruits of
                    all climates in the marketplace, the produce of the sea-shore
                    and the Cordillera.–Beef and mutton excellent–the chief
                    supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore
                    produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about
                    the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most
                    valuable land a league from the town, half cultivated and half abandoned;
                    every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld;
                    no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they
                    will not work, and famine must ensue." </p>

         <p>
            <pb n="8"/>LANDS in AMERICA for SALE.</p>
         <p> THESE two adjoining TRACKS of LAND in the County of FAYETTE and State of
                    KENTUCKY. The one track consists of 7000 acres, and is divided into 15
                    plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations, are still
                    unsold, and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d.
                    per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres, and is to be
                    sold in one lot, at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water
                    running through these two tracks of land, which communicates with the
                    great river Ohio, so that Mills may be erect. </p>
         <p> In Fayette County is Lexington, where the Courts of the State of Kentucky
                    are held, and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the
                    neighbourhood of these lands, and Fayette county is the nearest and most
                    convenient for Philadelphia, Baltimore, City of Washington, &amp;c. The
                    soil of Kentucky is deep and black, and lies upon a bed of lime-stone
                    and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts, honey, poplar
                    and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass, clover, and wild
                    rye, grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants
                    grow spontaneously, and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite
                    fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat ,barley,
                    oats, flax, and hemp, yield abundantly; indeed, it is assumed that
                    there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre, but the common
                    produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre. </p>
         <p> Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil, and fine climate of
                    the country, no part of America has been to repidly settled. The
                    returns made to Congress, upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March
                    1793, there were upwards of 100,000. And, from their astonishing increase
                    since, they may be estimated at 200,000. Eleven years ago, Kentucky
                    lay in a forest, but now she exhibits an extensive settlement, divided into
                    seven populous counties, in which are a great number of flourishing towns,
                    and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia, Delaware, and
                    Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are
                    established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly
                    Gazette published. There are Paper Mills, O??? Mills, ???ing Mills, Saw Mills, and a great number of Grist Mills.
                    Considerable quantities of Sugar, are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works
                    are in every part of the country, and the inhabitants are supplied at a
                    low price. </p>
         <p> The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes
                    an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State, and is
                    entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth. </p>
         <p> For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger, writer to the
                    signet; David Niven, writer, Glasgow; or to Mr. John Finlayson, writer,

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="2"/> As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of
                    the Congress of the United States at New York, Nov. 6, gives an
                    impartial account of the situation of that counttry, we are
                    persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers. </p>
         <p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of
                        Representatives,IT is some aba???of the
                    satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present occasion, that in
                    felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity, generally, I
                    am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities, which
                    have for some time past, distressed our western frontier, have terminated. </p>
         <p>You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern than I communicate it,
                    that reiterated endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have
                    hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving
                    hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest
                    desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the
                    further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of
                    expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation, for peace, has
                    led to strenuous efforts, through various channels, to accomplish these
                        desirable puposes:–In making which efforts, I
                    consulted less my own anticipations of the events, or the scruples
                    which some considerations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find
                    the object attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, the
                    such is the case. </p>
         <p/>
         <p>A detail of the measures which have been pursued, and of their
                    consequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you
                    the want of success, thu s far, will, I trust, evince that means, as
                    proper and as efficacious, as could have been devised, have been employed.
                    The issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; but a
                    favourable one, though not to be despaired of, is not promised by any thing
                    that has yet happened. </p>
         <p>In the course of the attempts which have been made, some valuable citizens
                    have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction
                    commonly respected, even among savages, has been found, in this
                    instance, insufficient to protect from massacre, the emissaries of peace;
                    it will I presume, be duly considered, whether the occasiondoes not
                    call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased. </p>
         <p>It must add to your concern, to be informed, what besides the continuation
                    of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those
                    south of it.</p>
         <p> A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabiting five
                    villages on the ??? river, have
                    long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring
                    settlements. </p>
         <p> It was hoped that the treat of Holston, made with the Cherokee nation, in
                    July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the
                    event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas, aided by some banditti
                    of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton
                    and unproved hostilities, upon the citizens of the United States
                    in that quarter. </p>
         <p> I have reason to believe, that every predictable exertion has been made
                    (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for
                    the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the event of a failure
                    of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be
                    raised, have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete.
                    And pains have been taken to discipline, and put them in
                    condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A
                    delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were
                    pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in
                    itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement, from
                    the proper department, with regard to the number of troops raised, and
                    some other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and,
                    among other things, will enable Congress to judge whether some additional
                    stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable. </p>
         <p>In looking forward to the future expence of the operations, which may be
                    found inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive
                    that the product of the revenues for the present year, is likely to
                    supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community, for the service
                    of the ensuing year. This however, will be better ascertained in
                    the course of the session; and it is proper to add, that the information
                    alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities. </p>
         <p> I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, without again recommending to
                    your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision
                    for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior
                    frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians;
                    without which all ??? plans must
                    prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent
                    rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them, as agents, would also
                    contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in
                    addition to these expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for
                    promoing civilization among the friendly tribes, and for carrying on
                    trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants, and under regulation
                        calction, its influence in cementing their interest
                    with ours could not but be considerable. </p>
         <p> The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be
                    still more the case, were it not for the impediments which in some
                    places continue to embarrass the collection of ???duties on spirits, distilled within
                    the United States.</p>
         <p>These impediments have lessened, and are ?ess???din local extent; and as applied to the community
                    at large, the contentment with the law app??? to be progressive.</p>
         <p> But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in
                    certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part, proper
                    and adviseable, and under this impression have issued a proclamation,
                    warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings,
                    having for this object, or tending to obstruct the operation of the
                    law in question, and announcing that all lawful ways and means
                    would be strictly put in excution, for bring to justice the
                    infractors thereof, and securing obedience thereto.</p>
         <p> Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders.
                    And Congress may be assured, that nothing within constitutional and legal
                    limits which may depend on me, shall be wanting ???sert and maintain the just
                    authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon
                    the full co-operation of the other departments of the government, and
                    upon the zealous support of all good citizens.</p>
         <p>I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject
                    of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court, which will be laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences that are being
                    experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws,
                    considerations rise out of the structure of that system, which some cases,
                        ???to relax their efficacy.
                    As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of
                        ???upon processes out of the Courts of the United States, and
                    supplementary definition of offence, against the constitution and laws of
                    the union, ???of the punishment for such offences, will, it is presumed,
                    be found worthy of particular attention. </p>
         <p> Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I
                    would be wise, however, by timely provisions, to guard against
                    those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb
                    it, and to put ourselves in a condition ???give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which ???may sometimes have occasion to require
                    from them. </p>
         <p> I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing
                    those aggressions by our citizens, on the territory of other nations, as
                    other infractions of the law of nations, which furnishes just subject
                    of complaint, might endanger our own peace with them. And, in
                    general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers
                    will be presented to your attention ???expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place, if not
                        re???, at the close of the present
                    session. </p>
         <p> In execution of the authority given by the legislature, measures
                    have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have
                    been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite
                    buildings, and therefore now putting into proper condition for the
                    purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the
                        coinage of half-dollars; the want of small coins in circulation calling the
                    first attention to them. </p>
         <p> The regulation of some provision in the law, which establishes the Post
                    Office, open to in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that,
                    upon the enquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the
                    importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and
                    information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy. </p>
         <p> The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky, has been notfied
                    to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction
                    which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of
                    the nation to which it relates, and conducive to the general order. </p>
         <p>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the
                    subject, and in further execution of the acts, severally making
                    provision for the public debt, and for the reduction
                    thereof, three new loans have been effected, each for three millions of
                    florins,—one at Antwerp, at the annual interest of four
                    and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of
                    all charages.–The rates of these loans, and the circumstance under
                    which they have been made, ar confirmations of the high state of our credit
                    abroad. </p>
         <p> Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied,
                    the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to
                    the provision made during the last session, has been embraced. </p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the House of
                            Representatives,I entertain a strong hope, that the state
                    of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to
                    enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the
                    regular redemption and discharge of the public debt, according to the
                    right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can
                    be more desirable, whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic
                    importance, or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation. </p>
         <p> Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the
                    loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the
                        section of the act by which it is incorporated. In
                    fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, it is expected a
                    valuable saving will be made. </p>
         <p> Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year, and
                    for such extraordinaries as may require provision, will demand, and I doubt
                    not, engage your early attention. </p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of
                                Representatives,I content myself with recalling your attention, generally to such
                    objects, not particularized in my present, as have been suggested in my
                    former communications to you. </p>
         <p> Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among
                    these, that which regulates trade and intercourse with the
                    Indian tribes, will merit your particular notice. </p>
         <p> The results of your common deliberations hitherto, will, I
                    trust, be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes;
                    such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend to strength and confirm their attachment, upon which,
                    under Divine Providence, materially depend their union, their safety, and
                    their happiness. </p>
         <p>Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends, there
                    is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful
                        cultivatino of harmony, combined with a due regard to
                    stability in the public councils.</p>
         <p>G. WASHINGTON.</p>

            <pb n="2"/>EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS.</p>
         <p>New York, July 5.</p>
         <p> This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed, last
                    Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado, which
                    continued about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of trees, unroofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city.
                    Unused to such unruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the
                    fair, were thrown into a momentary d???ation. Terrible was the havoc on the water–in
                    vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for
                    mercy–in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, were they hurried to
                    the bottom, and melancholy was the scene. It is said that
                    29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood, but we have
                    not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says, that a
                    Mr. Wade, his wife and two of their children, his brother,
                    and a young man, were all, except the last mentioned, drowned from one boat
                    near Yellow Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop
                    overset with 16 persons, all but one of whom were drowned. </p>
         <p> We learn that the ??? extended to
                        Philadelphia, that ship was driven from her moorings
                    there and sunk, and that the road from thence to this city, shrewn
                    violent tokens of its visitation. </p>
         <p>July 14.</p>
         <p> The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar, met at Albany,
                    July 3, have granted 75 dollars, bounty, to Thaddeus Scribner,
                    of Herkermer county, for having produced 600 lb. of grained maple
                    sugar, of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of
                    Otsego, for producing sugar of equal quality, but a less
                    quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris, and R. Huntley, of
                    Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. The society resolved, to
                    exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text
                    session, in order to induce them to give larger bounties, for
                    the further encouragement of this important manufacture. </p>
         <p>Aug. 4.</p>
         <p> On Saturday last, arrived in this city, directly from
                    Scotland.–Nesbit, Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by
                    the celebrated Dr. Robinson, and several other literary characters of eminence in that country, as a master of the science
                    of canaling, from several years experience both in Holland and
                    in Scotland. </p>
         <p> The President of the Northern Inland L. ?.Company, attended by Mr. Nesbit, and a commitee of
                    Directors, left this city, this morning on a tour, to explore the rive from
                    Troy upwards, for the purpose of prosecuting the canals with spirit
                    the remaining part of the season, and making preparations for
                    its more active prosecution in the ensuing year. </p>
         <p>Philadelphia, July 12.</p>
         <p> Accounts from South Carolina and Georgia, with regard to their prospects of
                    the ensuing crops, are very unfavourable, no rains of any consequence
                    having fallen in the more eastern disctricts of these states since the
                    beginning of April; at which time the low country was, in a manner
                    inundaed. The Indigo plantations, when the last vessels sailed, were
                    almost despaired of, for the next crop, and the rice swamps promised not
                    much better. </p>
         <p>July 18.</p>
         <p> We are sorry to learn from New York, that spirit of party, respecting a
                    late election of Governor" of the State, has arisen to such a
                    height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On Thursday morning last, Colonel W??? and Mr.
                        Wilcocks, both of New York, had a meeting, and exchanged pistol shot, but their friends in ???prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is friendly to
                    Governor Clinton's election, which Mr. Wilcock opposes. </p>
         <p> We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are
                    about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge,
                    the study of the constitution of their country, and the keeping up among
                    the people if possible, a knowledge of their rights as free citizens
                    of the greatest, and perhaps the only, true republic in the universe. </p>
         <p>August 6.</p>
         <p> On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very melancholy event at
                    Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill, in lower Merion township, Montgomery country,
                    between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large quantity of powder in
                    the mill, which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion,
                    which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there supposed to be an
                    earthquake. Mr Kizer, and three others who were in the mill, were blown to
                    pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded
                    that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be
                    near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her legs broken, and
                    was otherwise very much injured, by one of the rafters which was carried
                    from the building in the violence of the explosion. </p>
         <p>Petersburgh, July10.</p>
         <p> We learn from North Carolina, that a fire broke out in the town of
                    Washington, on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half
                    the town.–The loss in houses, goods, &amp;c. is said to be very
                    considerable. </p>

         <p> Extract of a letter from Captain Paul, of the State Levies, dated Middle
                    Block house, of the frontiers of Washington country, July 16,
                    1792." </p>
         <p>"The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman, and stole seven
                    horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col. Shepherd's in Ohio
                    county, Virginia.–Lieut. Gray and fourteen of my men
                    followed them over the Ohio, as far as the head of the Soufish, but the
                    Indians being on horseback they returned without coming up with them.
                    On Saturday last, at Dilly's station opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the
                    Indians came into one of the houses and killed four and wounded one;
                    the number of Indians was supposed to be twenty. It is thought they will
                    strike this quarter. To-morrow morning I intend to start with a party
                    to try and fall in with them." </p>
         <p>Martinsburgh, July 24.</p>
         <p> We are informed, that one day last week, a Mr. Barret, living near the
                    South Branch, accidentally shot his wife;–he was fixing a
                    flint to his gun, and incautiously dragging the trigger, not knowing
                    the gun was loaded, discharged the whole contents into her body, and she
                    died in a few moments after–the unfortunate woman had a young
                    child at her breast, but it providentially received no injury. </p>

         <p>Pittsburgh, Sept. 7.</p>
         <p>SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the commissioners who were
                    sent to treat with the Indians: he had left the commissioners on this side
                    of Lake Erie, that day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian
                    commissioners, and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the
                    mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit, where our commissioners were
                    directed to remain, until an asswer should be brought from the
                    great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the
                    Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this
                    effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the
                    country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners
                    suggested the impossibilities of doing this, as the lands had been sold by
                    the Congress, and people had settled on them, but that the United States
                    would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time.
                    The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to
                    the people that had settled, the would leave the land, and remove the
                    difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have, and
                    would not give it up. The Indians said it was well, and there
                    need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper
                    until they returned to the council, and laid this before them. On the
                    16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their
                    deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion
                    from the language of individual Indians in private, and from other
                    circumstances, that the British wholly conduct their council, and
                    dictate their demands. </p>
         <p> By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last, we are
                    informed, that the Indians still contiue hovering about our
                    garrisons, and occasionally stealing horses, that the army is in high
                    spirits, anxiously waiting the event of the treaty, and hoping that a
                    campaign will take place, as no idea of peace is entertained by any one;
                    that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief, in
                    training his men in the act wood fighting, and that from their proficiency,
                    and the ???imity prevailing throughout the whole army, success may be expected
                    should a campaign take place. </p>

         <p> A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to
                    Governors Island, where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia
                    last Thursday, was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever, and the event proved
                    their opinion to be just. </p>
         <p> According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several
                    religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1, 1792 to
                    August 1, 1793, the Births amounted to 2511, and the Death to
                    1467." </p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Sept. 21.</p>
         <p> The stages for New-York returned to this city, with all the passengers
                    (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow
                    escape with his life, being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing
                    within a few inches of his head! The ladies, &amp;. have been
                    without any refreshment on the road, as the panic and terror
                    with which every mind is possessed, by the writings and measures above alluded to, prevented their obtaining any accommodations
                    on the road–O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in
                        the streets of Askelon! Ye New Yorkers and
                    ye Baltimorians, you have been generous to
                    strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due
                    to your own fellow-citizens!" </p>

         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his
                        city, on his way to the southward.</p>
         <p> "We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men, who used us
                    with every indignity and hatred, truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in
                    the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during
                    this interval, one of these ruffians, who appeared to be a
                    German, snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave
                    the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the
                    road; this guard, in their tender mercy, wre pleased
                    to hand us a piece of dry cheese, on the end of a pitch-fork. After
                    this quarantine, we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden, and there to
                    perform another, for the space of two days and nights." </p>
         <p>New-York, Sept. 28.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in
                        Baltimore, dated the 20th instant.</p>
         <p> "You request I would endeavour to give you a particular account of the
                    state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant
                    fever now raging here. </p>
         <p> "I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it
                    is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois, in a vessel
                    which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street, beause the
                    infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel, and it was
                        afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook
                    several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the
                    general fall-fever, which acted severly on those who had the
                    influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the
                    death of Peter Ashton, in Vine-street, who after a short illness, died
                    about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly
                    discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever, and each person became after
                    of his neighbours, insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided, and many fled from the sick, leaving them in a destitute situation, perhaps shut up in a house, and the neighbours
                    alarmed, merchants and housekeepers moved into the country, and
                    fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness
                    possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except
                    packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country, and
                    searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without
                    having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became
                        alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot
                    learn ?hat it spread there. </p>
         <p>"The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy, and several of them were taken
                    sick; others abandoned their post, and the business bore very hard on the
                    remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly, they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in
                    Water, Front, Race and Vine-street, threatened desolation in those
                    quarters. The overseers, moved by the distresses of the helpless, took
                    possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital,
                    employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations, and provided for interring the dead. </p>
         <p> "The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in
                    number, and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the
                    nurses, two and three dollars per day, most of the magistrates fled;
                    the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people, who had
                    been private patientes on the poor list, abandoned and had no
                    sheltering place, and those who were slightly indisposed, were sent to
                    Bush-Hill and became victims with many others. </p>
         <p> "The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement, and a
                    committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital, and
                    to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became
                    organized, Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank, two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill
                    properly conducted; bedsteads were procured, the house cleaned,
                    matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an
                    apothecary, with medicine, &amp;c. and four physicians to attend
                    once a day. </p>
         <p> The remainder of the committee attend at the State House, receive
                    information from the committee at Bush-Hill, and supply their demands;
                    receive all sheets, shirts, &amp;c. &amp;c. at the State-House, also keep a
                    supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the
                    fever, of disposing the corps,and for carrying provisions and other
                    necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up, and
                    under the care of a matron, to be for the use of those children whose
                    parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are
                    shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open
                    for their use, and they to be accountable to him for their
                    expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary, and business at a
                    stand; deaths numerous, and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do
                    not ring, nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about
                    1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance, but it
                    cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15
                    and 20,000 removed from their habitations. </p>
         <p> "The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how
                    that is I know now." </p>
         <p> By a passenger, arrived from Albany this morning, we learn that, in order
                    to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany, they
                    have formed Committees, and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the
                    city, where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the
                    passengers–And, that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived, but
                    were denied admittance into the city, and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's, at Green-Bush. </p>
         <p>October 2.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia, to
                        the Printers of this PAper, dated September 28.</p>
         <p> "The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy
                    situation of this city, for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been
                    the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging,
                    where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From
                    the most accurate observations I can make upon matters, I think I
                    speak within bounds, when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I
                    do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of
                    August, in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I
                    confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present, and
                    it will take some time to have accurate returns made. </p>
         <p> "People have been hitherto so panic struck, that little has been attnded to
                    but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every
                    persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street
                    are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted, the
                    markets miserable and uncommonly high, and nearly one half the citizens
                    departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction
                    have in a great measure disadpeared, and bad Plato himself come
                    among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim, his lectures
                    could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the
                    present mortality. </p>
         <p> "We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion, than not
                    going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired, clean, and
                    frequently having the walls, white-washed. considering the general terro, I
                    have more than once felt my pulse, to discover whether I was really
                    alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape, as cool weather is
                    fast approaching, and one-street in general healthy. </p>
         <p>"Of all things, this yellow fever is the most insidious–its
                    approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when
                    he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely, and
                    die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long
                    left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of
                    a person, it does not easily let him get off. </p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Oct. 7.</p>
         <p>Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell, Esq. Speaker of the Senate of
                    this commonwealth, a gentleman of a benevolent disposition, an improved
                    mind, a sound understanding, and an honest heart.</p>
         <p>Died, on Friday evening, after a short illness, with the present maligant
                    fever at Mrs. Grant's,–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable
                    connections of Baltimore.</p>
         <p>Winchester, Sept. 20.</p>
         <p>Extract of a letter from our correspondent at ???Creek Territory, South of the Ohio, dated Sept. 4. </p>
         <p>"Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The ???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th
                    of August a party, consisting of about 300, killed Lieut. Janks Tedford, of the United States troops, and a Mr. JAckson, as
                    they were gathering corn in a field for their horses, near Henry's
                    stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile, and
                    destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat, rye and corn. WE hope Governor
                    Blount on his return to this territory, will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes." </p>
         <p>From the same, dated Sept. 14.</p>
         <p> "On the 30th of August, some Indians killed one young woman and scalped
                    another, in Washington county; and on the 5th instant, a part of them
                    wounded four persons, and scalped one, about nine miles from
                    Green Court-House; a house was also attacked by them, but they were
                    forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters, who
                    fired several rounds, and wounded some of them. On the 16th, another party
                    of the savages killed a woman and child, on Nine-Mile." </p>
         <p>New-York, Oct. 16.</p>
         <p> Monday evening last, a number of persons assembled in the fields, when they
                    commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house, which in a short
                    time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture,
                    beds, clothing, &amp;c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted
                    by Mother Giles, under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons
                    were wounded, one dangerously, from the firing of small arms, by some
                    persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that
                    our worthy Mayor, received some injury, in endeavouring to disperse the
                    people. </p>

            <pb n="3"/> The following new cities, independent of innumerable
                    small towns, have been lately begun to be built in America. The city of
                    Washington, which, in the year 1800, is to be the capital of the United
                    States; the city of Paterson, in the State of New Jersey; the city of Hudson,
                    upon the North River, in the state of New York; the city of Columbia,
                    which is now the capital of the State of South Carolina; the city of Martenberg,
                    now the capital of North Carolina; the city of Knoxcille, in teh new
                    district of Franklyn; the city of Nuskville, in the new district of
                        Cumberland; the city of Lexington, and the city of
                    Donxville, in the new State of Kentucky; and the city of Bennington,
                    in the new state of Vermont. The ground is also marked out, and
                    the lots are upon sale, for building one more new city, to be called
                    Newport, on the river Potowmac, and another called Athens, on the banks of
                    the Mississippi. </p>

         <p> THE Secretary of the Senate announced, that the Members of the Senate were
                    ready to admit the Members of the House of Representatives
                    in the Senate Chamber, in order to receive the President's
                    communication. </p>
         <p>FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF
                        REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p> Since the commencement of the term for which I havebeen again called into
                    office, no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at
                    large, the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony
                    of public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my
                    gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality
                    with which I have been honoured by my country; on the other, it could not
                    prevent an earnest wish for that retirement, from which no private
                    consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief, that
                    my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people, and the authorities derived from them, would
                    support exertions having nothing personal for their object, I
                    have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power;
                    and I humbly implore that Being, on whose will the fate of nations
                    depends, to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the
                    general happiness.</p>
         <p> As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United
                    States have the most extensive relations there was reason to
                    apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted, and our
                    disposition for peace drawn into question, by the suspicions too often
                    entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty
                    to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband
                    trade, and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a
                    declaration of the existing legal state of things, an easier
                    admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under
                    these impressions, the proclamation, which will be laid before you, was
                    issued.</p>
         <p>In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to
                    adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the
                    privileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system which
                    will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at
                    liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes, permitted by our
                    treaty of commerce with France, to be brought into our ports; I have not
                    refused to cause them to be restored, when they were taken within the
                    protection of our territory, or by vessels commissioned, or equipped in
                    a warlike form within the limits of the United States.</p>
         <p>It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, im prove, or
                    enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found
                    expedient to extend the legal code, and the jurisdiction of the Courts of
                    the United States to many cases which, though dependent on
                    principles already recognized, demand some further provisions.</p>
         <p> Where individuals shall, within the United States, array
                    themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon
                    military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the United
                    States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of
                    nations may have been indistinctly marked, or are inadequate; those
                    offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention, and require
                    prompt and decisive remedies.</p>
         <p>Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by the
                    judiciary, who possess a long-established course of
                    investigation, effectual process, and officers in the habit of
                    executing it. </p>
         <p>In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particular
                    circumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,
                    and even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a false
                    colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to
                        liberate certain captures within the protection of our
                        territory; it would seem proper to regulate their
                    jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in
                    either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be
                    authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts, when, for his own
                    information, he shall request it.</p>
         <p>I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our
                    duties to the rest of the world, without again pressing upon you
                    the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense, and
                    of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion, that, contrary to the order of human events, they will for ever keep
                    at a distance those painful appeals to arms, with which the history of
                    every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among
                    nations, which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation
                    of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; If
                    we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our
                    rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.
                    The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount, and
                    kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and
                    yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected,
                    as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike
                    apparatus in the moment of public danger.</p>
         <p>Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the
                    censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They
                    are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a
                    pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and may be
                    trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency
                    of the United States. But it is an enquiry which cannot be too
                    solemnly pursued, whether the act, "more effectually to provide for the
                    national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the
                    United States," has organized them so as to produce their full effect;
                    whether your own experience in the several States has not
                    detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature
                    in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity
                    for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely
                    ever be attained by practice alone. </p>
         <p>The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely
                    interesting. The occurrences which relate to it ,and have passed under the
                    knowledge of the Executive, will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent
                    communication.</p>
         <p>When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that
                    every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension
                    with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to
                    the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace, and a liberality, having no restriction
                    but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt,
                    however, of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have
                    marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not
                    arrest the progress of military preparation, it is doubtful how far the
                    advance of the season, before good faith justified active movements, may
                    retard them, during the remainder of the year. From the papers and
                    intelligence, which relate to this important subject,  you will determine
                    whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be
                    compensated by succors of militia, or additional encouragements
                    shall be proposed to recruits. </p>
         <p>An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace
                    with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved
                    with corn and with clothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited
                    during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the
                    latter, prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed
                    upon them. But the papers which will be delivered to you, disclose the
                    critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it
                    is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done.</p>
         <p> After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it
                    will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the
                    savages permanent, by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous
                    execution of justice on the violators of peace, the establishment of
                    commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States, is
                    most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted
                    without fraud, without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a
                    ready market for the commodities of the Indians, and a stated
                    price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange.
                    Individuals will not pursue such a traffic, unless they be allured by
                    the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be
                    reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress,
                    they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet
                    in the hands of the Executive.</p>
         <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, </p>
         <p> The commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the
                    United and Individual States concluded their important function
                    within the limited time by law; and the balances struck in their report,
                    which will be laid before congress, have been placed on the books of
                    the Treasury. </p>
         <p>On the 1st day of June last, an installment of on million of
                    florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This
                    was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement, in nature of
                    a new loan, at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years;
                    and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per
                    cent.</p>
         <p>The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank
                    of the United States, has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second
                    it is necessary that provision be made.</p>
         <p>No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the redemption and discharge
                    of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious, or an economy of
                    time more valuable.</p>
         <p>The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto, has continued to equal
                    the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not
                    expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been
                    suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be
                        requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens
                    who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a
                    future accumulation of burdens.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="2"/>But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the
                    transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the
                    government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an
                        enlightened policy; and to this primary good, nothing can
                    conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings,
                    diffused, without restraint, throughout the United States. An estimate of the
                    appropriations necessary for the  current service of the ensuing year
                    and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores, made during the
                        recess will be presented to Congress. </p>
         <p>GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, </p>
         <p> The several subjects, to which I have now referred, open a wide
                    range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of
                    our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of
                    your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness, the welfare of the
                    government may be hazarded; without harmony, as far as consists with
                    freedom of sentiment, its dignity may be lost.–But as the
                    legislative proceedings of the United States will never, I trust, be
                    reproached for the want of temper or of candour, so shall not the public
                    happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest
                    cooperation. </p>
         <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, Dec. 3, 1793</p>
         <p>The President having withdrawn, the Members of the House of Representatives
                    returned to their Chamber, where the President's Address was read, and
                    referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer.</p>
         <p>A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last
                    House.–Adjourned.</p>
         <p>Thursday, Dec. 5.</p>
         <p>The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It
                    is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians
                    contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the
                    Commissioners, drawn up in a masterly manner, it bears all the
                    appearance of EUropean logic, faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the
                    documents relative to this business were referred to a Committee of
                    the whole on the state of the Union.</p>
         <p>A message was received from the President, communication sundry
                    papers relative to our European relations, and also the result of the
                    proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of
                    the United States with the Individual States.</p>
         <p>The first set of papers is introduced by a message, of which the following
                    is a copy:</p>
         <p>United States, Dec. 5, 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF
                        REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
         <p>As the present situations of the several nations of Europe, and especially
                    of those with whom the United States have important relations, cannot but
                    render the state of things between them and us; matter of interesting
                    enquiry to the Legislature, and may indeed give rise to deliberations to
                    which they alone are competent, I have thought it my duty to communicate
                    them certain correspondencies which have taken place.</p>
         <p>The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally
                    a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our
                    commerce and navigation, and have made overtures for placing these
                    advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National
                    Assembly, subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried
                    into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a
                    friend, contrary to our treaty, though revoked at one time, as to the
                    United States, has been since extended to their vessels also, as has
                    been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject
                    will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there, and the result
                    shall be communicated to the Legislature.</p>
         <p>It is with extreme concern I have to inform you, that the proceedings of the
                    person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary
                    here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which
                    sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war
                    abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his
                    agents, have threatened our immediate commitment in the war, or
                    flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect has been
                    counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws, and by an exertions of
                    the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent, they have
                    been born with, from sentiments of regard to his nation, from a sense
                    of their friendship towards us, from a conviction that they would not
                    suffer us to remain long exposed to  the action of a person who has so
                    little respectedour mutual dispositions, and, I will add, from a reliance
                    on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and
                    order. In the mean time, I have respected and pursued the
                    stipulations of our treaties, according to what I judge the true sense; and
                    have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from
                    us, and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone
                    further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of
                    certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore, I
                    thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties, by avowing it to be my
                    opinion, that if restitution were not made, it would be incumbent on the
                    United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will
                    more particularly apprize you of these transactions.</p>
         <p>The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our
                    vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the
                    belligerent powers, appeared to require attention. The proofs of these
                    however not having been brought forward, the description of
                    citizens supposed to have suffered were notified, that on
                    furnishing them to the Executive Power, due measures would be taken to
                    obtain redress of the past, and more effectual provisions against the future.
                    Should such documents be furnished ,proper representations will be made
                    thereon, with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case.</p>
         <p>The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of
                    their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn
                    and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends, the
                    instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time, some discussions on the subject took place between him and them; these are
                    also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special
                    instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their
                    present sessions.</p>
         <p>Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here, mutual explanation
                    on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that
                    Minister; these are now laid before you for your information.</p>
         <p>On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and
                    Spain, negociations and conferences are now depending. The
                    public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the
                    legislature in confidence only, they shall be the subject of a
                    separate and subsequent communication.</p>
         <p>G. WASHINGTON</p>
         <p>Mr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the
                    President.</p>
         <p>The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the
                    papers received from the President, which are voluminous. </p>

         <p>Two men named Timmons, brothers, as also one Nimrod Higgins, were killed in
                    the wilderness  between Yellow Creek, and Cumberland Mountain, about
                    the 20th ult. by Indians.</p>
         <p>Three persons were also lately killed by Indians in Harrison county, near
                    the mouth of the Little Kennaway.</p>
         <p>By a letter from the territory south of the Ohio, dated April 25, we learn,
                    that on the 22d of that month, a large party of Indians killed sever person
                    within seven miles of Knoxville, and stole 60 horses from Knox County;
                    that parties of them are daily committing ravages in the territory, and
                    that there is no prospect of putting a stop to their enormities while
                    the Whites are restricted from pursuing them across the Tenessee.</p>

            <pb n="1"/>United States, June 4, 1794.</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of
                        Representatives,</p>
         <p>Lay before Congress the copy of a letter, with its enclosure,
                    from the Secretary of State to the Minister Plenipotentiary of his
                    Britannic Majesty; it being an answer to a letter from the Mnister to him;
                    bearing date the 22 ult. and already communicated.</p>
         <p>GEO. WASHINGTON.</p>
         <p>Philadelphia, June 2, 1794.</p>
         <p>SIR,</p>
         <p>If, the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d
                    ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination against
                    the United States, I should not now trouble you with a return to its
                    unpleasant topics. Among the reasons, which would have induced
                    me to add nothing to my letter the 1st of lat month, its would have been
                    of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repetition of a style and manner, which seem to have produced a personal
                    excitement.</p>
         <p> As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord Dorcester's speech, we
                    will, with your approbation, reserve for a future discussion, on
                    what occasion, and to what degree, an explanation may be required by the
                        government of the United States from a foreign minister.</p>
         <p>I selected only one passage of that speech, because in it was concentrated
                    the real object of the whole; which was to declare an expectation, that
                    Great Britain would be at War with the united States in the course of the
                        present year. and, if she were, to cause the warriors to
                    draw a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-general, unaffected by the preliminary words, which you have thought proper
                    to quote. It is your own interpretation. For so far are you from
                    contradicting my assertion, that Lord Dorchester fostered and
                    encouraged in the Indians, hostile dispositions towards us, that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to
                    vindicate his persuasion and your own, that the principal aggression,
                    leading to hostility, proceeded from the United States and to suggest many
                    others of the same tendency, upon which you would not dilate. </p>
         <p> I shall not shrink, Sir, from your charges. </p>
         <p>1st Notwithstanding the territory, upon which certain inhabitants of Vermont
                    are presented in your letter of the 5th of July, 1792, to have trespassed,
                    belong to the United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did my
                    predecessor give you, as is admitted, positive assurances of the
                    determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint. The
                    necessary instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state. On
                    examining your correspondence with my department, it does not appear that from the 9th of July, 1792, to the 10th of March,
                    1794 upwards of nineteen months, our government ever unrdestood
                    from yourself, or any authority of his Britannic Majesty, that
                    the original dissatisfaction continued. Nor was any discontent
                    heard from that quarter through other channels, except what
                    related to outrages upon our own citizens by British subjects.
                    Then, indeed, thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had been
                    assembled by Lord Dorchester, at Quebec, you renew your
                    remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means believed, that this was
                    written, in order to ausher in the intelligence, which soon after arrived on his
                    speech; ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the
                    circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer, although delayed for
                    fifty days, until the 19th of April, 1794, to be constured into an assent to any
                    charge, since at the end of that period, having been disappointed, as my
                    letter shews, in one opportunity of information, and no other presenting
                    itself, we were not in a capacity of contradicting your
                    assertions. However, Sir, the instructions, issued in consequence of your
                    application, conveyed positive orders for the correction of
                    what, upon examination, should be found irregular. </p>
         <p>2d, Among the points, to which you intimate that you might have adverted, is
                    enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at Charleston, South Carolina.
                    Whatever this transaction might have been, it probably occurred at the
                    commencement of the war, and before the existence of the war was
                    communicated to our government, by any of the powers engaged. Had such a
                    transaction been known to the President in time, you can well judge from
                    his actual conduct, what he would then have done. His proclamation on the 2nd of April, 1793, his call upon the state governors on
                    the 26th of the same months, to co-operate with him in the work
                    of impartiality and peace; the system of rules which he established, and
                    which were imparted to you, are unerring indications of the
                    spirit of those measures, on which he had determined. He suppressed the consular courts, which attempted to pass sentences
                    of condemnation on captures; he restored several vessels to British owners;
                    prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of
                    neutrality. In a word, Sir, what has been required, under the sanction of
                    the law of nations, which had not been fulfilled? How many things have been spontaneously done, to evince our impartiality? Let me
                    request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22, May 15, June
                    5, August 7, 8, 25, September 5 and 12, 1793: and to say if more
                    could be well expected from us? After such demonstrations, it might
                    have been hoped, that the equipment of these two privateers
                    would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But the letter of the 5th of
                    June being conceived of itself to be satisfactory, is here inserted.</p>
         <p>"In the letter which I had the honour of writing you on the 15th of May, in
                    answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month, I mentioned that
                    the President, reserved for further consideration, a part of the one which
                    related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of Charleston.
                    The part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the
                    executive government of the United States would pursue measures for
                    represeeing such practices in the future, and for restoring to their
                    rightful owners any captures which such privateers might be bring into
                    the ports of the United States."</p>
         <p> "The President,after a full investigation of this subject, and the most
                    mature consideration, has charged me to communicate to you, that the first
                    part of this application is found to be jest, and that effectual measures
                    are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but
                    that the latter part, desiring restitution of the prizes, is understood to
                    be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes, and
                    would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other party</p>
         <p>"The principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being within
                    the United States, at the moment a war broke out between their own and
                    another country, they determine to go in its defence; they purchase, arm,
                    and equip a vessel, with their own money, man it themselves, receive a regular commission from their nation, depart
                    out of the United states, and then commence hostilities by
                    capturing a vessel If, under these circumstance, the commission
                    of the captors was valid, the property, according to the laws of
                    war, was, by the capture, transferred to them; and it would be
                    an aggression on their nation, for the United states to rescue
                    it from them, whether on the high seas, or on coming into their ports. If
                    the commission was not valid and consequently, the property not
                    transferred by the laws of war, to the capture, then the case would have
                    been cognizable in our courts of admiralty, and the owners might
                    have gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition,
                    would the executive be justifiable in interposing.</p>
         <p>With respect to the United States, the transaction can in no wise be imputed
                    to them. It was in the first moment of the war,ߝin one of
                    the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the
                    government to meet all the cases, which such a state of things was to
                    produce, impossible to have known, and therefore impossible to have been
                    prevented by that government.</p>
         <p>"The moment it was known, the most energetic orders were sent to
                    every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the
                    accident. On a suggestion, that citizens of the United States had taken
                    part in the act, one who was designated, was instantly committed to prison,
                    for prosecution; one or two others have been since named, and
                    committed in like manner; and should it appear, that there were still
                    others, no measures would be spared to bring them to justice. The President
                    had even gone farther; He has required, as a reparation of their
                    breach of respect to the United States, that the vessels so armed and
                    equipped, shall depart from our ports. </p>
         <p>"You will see, Sir, in these proceedings of the President,
                    unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right, which he means to pursue.
                    The measures now mentioned, are taken in justice to the one part; the
                    ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes, is declined in
                    justice to the other; and the evil, thus early arrested, will be of
                    very limited effects; perhaps, indeed, soon disappear altogether."</p>
         <p> As to the permission from the governor of South Carolina,
                        ??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ???
                        ???, you  may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I
                    take the liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have of
                    it</p>
         <p> 3. With so many direct proofs in your hands, of the opinion constantly
                    maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general
                    made by illegal privateers, it is not easily explained, why the
                    validity of those before the 5th of June, 1793, should be argued, from a
                    refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that date,
                    neither affirms nor disaffirms their validity; but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules
                    which govern such cases. Those ruled are That if the commission be good,
                    the capture is good; if the commission be bad, the capture is bad; but
                    whether it be good or bad, is not decided; it being enough to prove,
                    that the transaction, for the reasons assigned, can in no wise be imputed
                    to the united States. But if captures of this kind, prior to the 5th of
                    June, 1792, do really amount (as is conceived by some) to no
                    very considerable value, this would of itself, lessen the importance of the
                        insinuation. </p>
         <p>4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of
                    the privateers le Petit Democrate and la Carmagnole, and the result will be
                    communicated to you. In the mean time, it is a matter of some surprise,
                    that vessels, whose single employment and profit, must consist in
                    cruizing on the ocean, should have remained in the port of New-York during
                    the whole winter, and probably up to the date of your letter (May 22d,
                    1794) May it not be presumed, that their activity has been checked by the
                    intervention of the government? But, sir, if they have not been
                    dismantled, your letter brings the first notice of the omission.</p>
         <p> 5th. It is true, that the sale of prizes made by French cruizers, has not
                    been prohibited in the United States, and that our treaty with France has
                    been so interpreted, as not to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next
                    resort was to the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the
                    executive, with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to
                    all. Upon this, as on many other occasions, the civilians differ; Vattel
                    declaring, That a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral
                    port, and there freely sell it; Martens affirming the same doctrine, if it
                    has not been otherwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing
                    it. in this sxhism among the writers,it was resolved by the President of the United States, to impose no restraint upon
                    those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation, to congress, at
                    the earliest moment of their session. Thus much has been observed, not as
                    my final anser, but merely to introduce an assurance, that I
                    will follow you in the main discussion, whensoever you shall bring it
                    forward in detail. </p>
         <p>
            <pb n="2"/>6th. Undoubtedly, sir, you have been misinformed, that the vessels of France
                    have been permitted to depart from our ports, notwithstanding the embargo.
                    As the history of the executive proceedings is neither long, nor entangled,
                    it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embargo
                    was laid, expresses and advice boats were dispatched, to notify the officer
                    of the customs and revenue cutters, and all others concerned in its
                    execution. The resolution imposing it, involved all foreign
                    nations; the instructions from the United States, favoured no nation,
                    directly or indirectly. A French snow, La Camille, which had
                        descended the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her
                        voyage, was stopped by an officer of the United States; and
                    the President, adhering to perfect impartiality could not think
                    himself justified, to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a
                    passport. Passports being kept under the special view of the President were
                    issued only after his examinatino of each case, and the total
                    number of them does not exceed twenty-six. Among them, was one to yourself; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies, upon
                    a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in
                    various British courts of admiralty; one to a citizen whose vessel was
                    under trial in Bermuda, and who was anxious to forward the British
                    instructions of the 8th January, 1794, with a hope of rescuing her from
                        confiscation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in
                        Jamica; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate
                        inhabitants of St. Domingo, to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support, and who could
                    no longer endure their separation from home; one to some other persons
                    in peculiar circumstances, desirous of returning to the
                    West-Indies; and in the last instance, one to the Minister of the French
                    Republic. If, therefore, by any other passport, or permission;
                    the embargo has been relaxed, it was unauthorized by the President, and
                    unlawful. The distance of Hampton Road from this city, being more than
                    three hundred miles, the officers of government, resident  here,
                    could not learn, at the moment, what was passing there. No intelligence of
                    an official nature of any real importance. No complaint from any
                    other foreign minister, or any othe rpseron, has since reached us. If, Sir,
                    you should happen to possess the information, I ask it as a favour, of you,
                    to designate, who granted the permission, and under what circumstances the
                    French vessels left that road? An investigation, however, has been, and
                    shall be pursued, on our part, without delay. If the law has been
                    violated, it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law, is very
                    remote from a permission of the government. </p>
         <p> 7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the British
                    officers are said to have experienced in the United States, cannot be
                    answered, until it shall be more explicitly defined. Did this treatment
                    break forth in words or actions, not cognizable by law? If so,
                    no complaint can be offered to government. Or in words or action, which
                    were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners against citizens, and independent of influence. To yourself let me appeal,
                    that on the representations, which you thought proper to lay before the
                    President, in relation to the British consul at Baltimore, the
                    British consul at Norfolk, and the commander of the DȰdalus frigate,
                    the necessary measures were promptly adopted; the result has
                    been transmitted to you, and no objection has been returned. Nor
                    was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of
                    Philadelphia. And these eing the only occurrences of the kind
                    within my knowledge, i trust, that no example can be produced of government
                    refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable
                    occasion.</p>
         <p>8th. The events at Newport, in Rhode-Island are accurately
                    detailed in the proceedings, which I have the honour of
                    enclosing to you. Within the limits of the present letter, I
                    cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks,
                    when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate.
                    It is enough, therefore, for me to engage, that these animadversions, whenever they shall appear, shall receive particular
                    attention.</p>
         <p>Although, Sir, your charges against the United States are sketched only; the
                    impression, which may have been intended, cannot be counteracted too soon,
                    by such general elucidations, as at a future day may be more minutely unfolded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the United States, and
                    ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is not the place
                    for us to retort our complaints. But compare them with the whole
                    of your catalogue; and say, what may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace. </p>
         <p>9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the Indians
                    against us, is without justification; so is the expedition of
                    Governor Simcoe without pretext.</p>
         <p>That you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually
                    occurred, leaves room to conjecture, that you may not be without
                    intelligence of it having been designed; and that it has
                    therefore probably taken place. But you insist that much will depend on the
                    place intended for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on
                    the Miami, be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose
                    adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single glance of the eye
                    over the map, proves that its source is within the limits of the United
                    States. In its whole length it is flanked on each side by our territory.
                    Its very mouth is to the Southward of our line, as recognised by our
                        treaty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of
                    the rapids can a fort be built, but within out country. </p>
         <p>This being fixed, your argument is, that if the fort be for the purpose of
                    protecting subjects of his majesty, residing in districts,
                    dependent on the fort of Detroit, or of preventing that fortress
                    from being straitened by the approach of the American army; the principle
                    of statu quo, until the final arrangement of the point in
                    discussion between the two countries shall be concluded, will strictly
                    apply.</p>
         <p>To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing, concerning which a
                    treaty is opened, not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment, the
                    principle of statu quo has been generally adopted.
                    The nearest point of the rapids to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles.
                    They have never been considered, they never could be considered, as
                    appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say, tha tthe proposed
                    assumption of territory may depend on districts, which depend on Detroit.
                    It is too obvious to dwell upon the remark, that if Detroit
                    which lies within the United States, becomes the first station
                    from which a district may be generated, one encroachment may beget another
                        ad infinitum. It will, however, be very
                    acceptable to understand with accuracy, how much of our
                    territory towards the Miami was actually possessed by the military
                        establishment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the
                        military establishment; because if any subjects of his
                        Britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess,
                    they are, as being within our limits, under our jurisdiction.</p>
         <p>To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened by the approach of
                    the American army, is either a new modification of the preceding idea, or
                    founded upon a untenable suspicion. For the question must recur,
                    are the rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected with it at
                    the peace? If convenience only were to be consulted, and a wide
                    range of unsettled territory, by being suitable to the momentary
                    circumstances of one nation, is to be transferred for that reason alone
                    from another,  which is the true proprietor, we might even then controvert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be
                    consulted, our right is complete. Is then our territory to be thus
                    seized? Nay, more sir, I am authorized to say to you explicitly, that the
                    American army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that
                    post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration,
                    it ought to be discontinued without cause.</p>
         <p>I have the honour, Sir, to be with great
                        respect,Your most obedient servant,EDM. RANDOLPH.</p>
         <p>Mr. Hammond, MinisterPlenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty.</p>

      <text>
         <p>
            <pb n="4"/>Message from General Washington to Congress, May
                        21.</p>
         <p>"Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives,</p>
         <p>"I lay before you certain information, whereby it would appear
                    that some encroachment as about to be made on our territory, by an Officer
                    and party of British troops. Proceeding upon a supposition of the
                    authenticity of this information, although of a private nature, I have
                    caused the representation to be made to the British Minister, a copy of which accompanies this Message.</p>
         <p>"It cannot be necessary to comment upon the very serious nature of such an
                    encroachment, nor to urge that this new state of things suggests the
                    propriety of placing the united States in a posture of effectual
                    preparation for an event, which, notwithstanding the endeavours
                    making to avert it, may, y circumstances beyond our controul, be forced upon us. G.
                            Washington."</p>
         <p>By a letter from Mr. Randolph, the American Secretary of State, to Mr
                    Hammond, the information alluded to we find to be, "That
                    Governor Simcoe had gone to the foot of the Rapids of teh Miami,
                    followed by three companies of a British regiment, in order to build a fort
                    there"ߝWhich Mr. Hammond, in his answer, rather qualifies than
                    denies.</p>
         <p> In the debate in Congress, on taking off the embargo, several
                    members said they had voted for the embargo, merely as a part of a general
                    plan of retaliation upon Great Britain; but that as the more
                    effential parts of that plan, particularly the prohibiting
                    of all commercial intercourse between America and Great Britain
                    had been over-ruled, the embargo was injurious only to the subjects of teh
                    United States, and therefore ought to be taken off.</p>
         <p>In Philadelphia and several other ports, the masters and mates of
                    American ships held meetings, and published resolutions, declaring that
                    they would not put to sea, until they could be assured that their flag
                    would be respected, and their persons protected from such indignities as
                    many of them had lately experienced. This they did after the embargo was at
                    an end.</p>

            <pb n="5"/>Philadelphia, June 3. [Authentic.]</p>
         <p>Copy of a letter from General Wilkins, to
                            Col. C. Biddl, dated Pittsburgh, 23d
                            May, 1794.</p>
         <p> "I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen
                    minutes ago from Le Boeuf, and left the detachment there well covered, and
                    in good spirits. They have built, under my directions, two
                    small block-houses, picketed in, which I think will render them
                    sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny.</p>
         <p> "The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion
                    that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque
                    Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago, while I was there, an Indian from
                    Sandusky, where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe
                    says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, M'Kee, and Elliot the
                    Indian agent, (the two last refugees from this country)
                    were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter, and exciting
                    them to continue their opposition to the Americans, and assuring
                    them of support from their father the British monarch. He further adds
                    that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that
                    the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. He confirms the accounts of the other Indians, that they were
                    determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle."</p>
         <p>There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May.</p>

         <p>In the House of Representatives of the United
                            States, Thursday June 5, 1794.</p>
         <p>The House, according to the order of the day, resolved itself
                    into a committee of the whole House, on the report of the
                    Committee, to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People
                    west of the Alleghany Mountains, relative to the navigation of
                    the river Mississippi, and after some time spent therein, Mr. Speaker
                    resumed the chair, and Mr. Trumbull reported, that the Committee, according to order, had the same report under consideration, and
                    come to a resolution thereupon, which he delivered in at the Clerk's
                    table, where the same was twice read, and agreed to by the
                    House, as follows:</p>
         <p>Resolved, That as it appear, from the communications of the Executive, that
                    the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi,
                    is now the subject of negotiation with the Court of Spain; and
                    as it is the interest of the United States, and every part thereof, to come
                    to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode, rather than
                    resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the Legislature, no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance, during the present session of Congress.</p>
